[color=#ffff00]Mission Statement:

Delta-V is a Medium Roleplay server. Try to immerse yourself into your character. This includes doing your job, interacting with your fellow crewmates, and using roleplay as the primary vessel to play the game. MRP places less emphasis on "winning" and more on just telling a story.[/color]

[color=#ff0000]Server Disclaimers:[/color]
You must be at least 17 years of age to play on Delta-V’s servers. Any users suspected of being under the age of 17 will be removed.

Intentionally disconnecting, responding with hostility, or refusing to respond when an admin privately messages you in-game will be met with an appeal-only ban. Additionally, abusing the AHelp relay by flooding it with garbage, checking for admins before stating a problem (ex: "hello?", "any admins?"), using it as a chatroom, or sending messages of no substance will result in your removal. All AHelp messages are relayed to the Delta-V Discord.

The usage of any third-party applications/scripts/client modifications or any other applicable software to gain an advantage, avoid intended game/server mechanics, or to harm server infrastructure is strictly prohibited, as is the abuse of glitches, exploits and bugs. Any and all instances of this will be met with an appeal-only ban; please use the #bug-reports channel on the Discord to report any issues you find in-game.

If you have any questions about these rules, please use the admin help menu by hitting F1 in-game or clicking the "AHelp" button in the lobby.

[color=#a4885c]Community Rules:[/color]
[color=#a4885c]0.[/color] Admins can disregard any and all of these rules if they deem it in the best interest of the current round, server, and/or community at large.
 - Administrators will be held fully accountable for their actions if they exercise this privilege.
 - All of these rules apply as they are intended. Every example of a rule break cannot be defined as written, therefore, enforcement of the rules is subject to staff interpretation of the rule's intention.
 - Any extended discussion regarding interpretation of the rules should be avoided in the AHelp menu and can be instead pursued within the Delta-V Discord in the #help channel.

[color=#a4885c]E1.[/color] Erotic Roleplay (ERP), erotic content, or 18+ sexual content is [color=#ff0000]not allowed under any circumstance[/color]. This includes comments not explicitly sexual in nature that contain words, phrases, or ideations that are deemed inappropriate by staff or members. [color=#ff0000]If roleplay reaches a point where it has become sexual and/or uncomfortable, immediately stop and contact an administrator or moderator.[/color]

[color=#a4885c]E2.[/color] Delta-V is an English-based community; use English as your primary method of communication within the game and Delta-V servers.
 - Do not spam or advertise on our server.
 - Be respectful towards other members and avoid making others uncomfortable.
 - We have a zero tolerance policy for racism, sexism, homophobia, violence, threats, hate speech, slurs, and other forms of bigotry, discrimination, and harassment. Slurs and terms that use real or implied mental or physical disability to mock or denigrate members or their in-game characters are also strictly prohibited. Failure to comply with this rule will result in community removal.
 - The denigration of other player characters through reference to their species/morphotype or debasement by comparison to nonsophonts on a discriminatory basis is strictly prohibited and may result in an appeal-only ban.

[color=#a4885c]E3.[/color] Delta-V welcomes content creators and streamers to our community, but we have a few rules regarding livestreaming game servers.
 - While a stream delay is not necessary, it is highly recommended to have at least a 10 second delay.
 - Please let admins know you are streaming via the AHelp prior to doing so.
 - If your chat or viewers are in-game with you while also watching your stream, they are breaking our server rules. Please do not coordinate with them and discourage this behavior if it is seen.

[color=#a4885c]Game Server Rules:[/color]

[color=#a4885c]1.[/color] Follow the server expectations:
 - If you are banned from a role or department, you may not play that role. This includes seeking or accepting promotions into roles you are banned from.
 - Do not make yourself a major problem/annoyance/disruption for the crew while not being an antagonist (i.e. self-antagging). Intentionally hindering the station as a crew-aligned character is strictly against our rules.
 - Department strikes (e.g. cargonia and any variation thereof), riots, cults, and any other type of similar largely disruptive behavior are strictly forbidden without both excellent roleplay justification and administrator pre-approval.
 - AFK (a.k.a. SSD) and catatonic players are considered to have the same rights as any other crewmate.
    - If a player is dead and catatonic (not SSD), they are not required to be revived and may be stored in the morgue or otherwise handled by medical personnel.
    - If a player is alive and catatonic, they may be brought to their relevant department or cryostorage as necessary.

[color=#a4885c]2.[/color] Follow metagaming guidelines:
 - Do not use the Emote channel to bypass an inability to speak. This includes examples like "I’m friendly," "oh weird I can’t speak," or "mimes a flashlight".
    - Additionally, use of the emote channel to simulate character death rattles or other game mechanics is prohibited.
 - Use the local-out-of-character (LOOC) and global out-of-character (OOC) channels properly. Don’t speak of in-character matters in those channels unless you’re asking questions related to in-game concepts.
 - Do not use in-character channels to bypass a lack of ability to use OOC/LOOC chats (e.g. "Huh, wonder where the captain went? OOC He probably left to get dinner lol").
 - Do not engage in meta-communications (i.e. using external channels to communicate with other players in the same game).
    - Do not stream, discuss, or share information about the current round to the Delta-V Discord.
 - You are allowed to have knowledge of past experiences and prior shifts, and players are allowed to have in-character relationships (friends, enemies, or otherwise). However, this cannot be used as a sole reason to grant or deny items/accesses/favors based exclusively on having a relationship with one another (i.e. meta-friending/meta-grudging).
    - Antagonists in previous rounds must not be treated differently due to their prior antagonist status. Notwithstanding, confession of crimes committed in a prior shift are still admissible in court.
    - Additionally, and for the sake of continuity, your character will never have permanently died in previous rounds.
 - Do not "antag roll." This is the act of joining rounds for the purpose of seeing if you have received an antagonist role, and leaving soon after if not.

[color=#a4885c]3.[/color] Follow the new-life rules:
 - If a player dies and is brought back by way of cloning or borging, they forget the last five minutes leading up to their death and cannot describe who or what killed them.
 - Players that are revived by using a defibrillator CAN recall the circumstances of their death and do not have any forgetfulness/amnesia about what happened while they were conscious and awake.
 - In either case, characters do not have any knowledge of what happened while they were dead (i.e. ghosted/observing).

[color=#a4885c]4.[/color] Follow naming conventions:
In-character names must fit the server standards of:
 - Doesn't make obvious references,
 - Isn't an obvious pun or play on words,
 - Could be feasibly be on a company-issued ID,
   OR
 - Is a result of random name generation.
The only exception to the above is theatrical roles such as the clown, boxer, and mime; these roles are allowed stage names with some freedom, as long as it is not obscene. Administrators reserve the right to approve or deny character names at their discretion.

[color=#a4885c]5.[/color] Follow roleplay guidelines:
 - Your character is a separate entity from you, the player. Your character's actions, feelings, and knowledge in-game should be based solely on the character's experiences rather than your own as the player.
 - Low roleplay actions that have no regard for your character or little bearing on setting (such as memes, silly copy paste spam IC) are not acceptable. Your character is a worker aboard a space station and will be held accountable.
 - Do not escalate situations needlessly as a crew-aligned role. Very few things are deserving of a fight to the death.
    - If a fight results in someone being critically injured, seek medical help for them - and if they die, do not destroy or otherwise hide their body. This falls under self-antagonistic behavior.
    - Pest ghost roles such as mice are always fair game for attacking. Do not grief crew-aligned ghost roles such as familiars, drones, or pets without provocation.
       - Some awakened pest roles (e.g. sentient mothroach) may be considered crew pets and fall under this rule.
 - [color=#ff0000]Non-security personnel should not seek to kill or detain unrelated threats.[/color] Crew may neutralize threats when they present themselves or if they are relevant to the crew member in question.
    - Certain severe emergencies may make it reasonable for normal crew to defend themselves and their station, such as nuclear operatives, a zombie outbreak, or other critical situation.

[color=#a4885c]6.[/color] Follow powergaming guidelines:
Don't rush for or prepare equipment unrelated to your job for no purpose other than to have it "just in case" and without valid reason.
 - A medical doctor does not need insulated gloves, the Head of Personnel does not need a gun, and the Captain does not need the Head of Security’s hardsuit. If you, in your given role, require an item that does not fall within your job’s usual parameters, have a valid reason to obtain and keep it.
    - Manufacturing weapons, bombs, or deadly poisons before you know of any reason you would need them is self-antagonistic behavior.
 - Hiding Traitor objective items or preemptively securing them with higher security than usually required or than would make logical sense violates our powergaming and roleplay guidelines.
    - Do not, [color=#ff0000]under any circumstances[/color], hide the nuclear fission explosive, authentication disk, or other sensitive items in an impossible to see/access location.

[color=#a4885c]7.[/color] Follow end-of-round (EOR) rules:
 - Significant end-of-round grief (EORG) is not allowed. This includes attacking, destroying, polluting, and severely injuring without reason both at and on the way to Central Command.
    - Explosives and strategies with capacity for high collateral damage should not be used on or around the evacuation shuttle after it arrives.

[color=#a4885c]Command, Security, and Antagonist Rules:[/color]
[color=#a4885c]C1.[/color] Follow Command and Security Guidelines:
 - Security and Command roles are held to a higher standard of roleplay, and are expected to know and perform their jobs to the best of their ability. These roles often heavily impact the round and require more careful and conscientious roleplay; if you cannot meet these requirements do not take these roles.
    - Both departments are required to read and follow Delta-V Space Law, Standard Operating Procedure, Alert Procedure, and Company Policy to the best of their ability.
    - Abandoning your role to go do whatever you want instead of managing your department or maintaining security, abusing your position or using it to make arbitrary or malicious choices to the detriment of the station, and being negligent to the point of harm is prohibited.
 - If you need to leave the round, please notify administrators via AHelp menu and notify your fellow crew via departmental radio. If you have the capability to do so, ensure that you return your items as necessary and seek cryostorage if you are not planning on returning.
 - Do not give up or trade away Traitor objective items, departmental/Command gear, and sensitive equipment without excellent reason.
    - Some leeway is given to making deals with criminals [italic]if and only if[/italic] the deal benefits the safety or situation of the station or circumstances rather than just yourself (e.g. hostage situations).
    - Some leeway can be given in extreme circumstances of extreme shortstaffing and/or emergency/crisis.
 - Both Command and Security are expected to uphold the law and maintain order aboard the station. Do not engage in lawbreaking activity or troublemaker behavior, and ensure that company policy and standard operating procedure - not just space law - is being observed. Security is expected to intervene into criminal activity where possible and safe to do so. Heads of departments are at minimum expected to report criminal activity to Security and should cooperate with law enforcement where possible.
 - Do not hire random crew to be your bodyguard(s) or promote random crewmembers to Command positions at random. If you require bodyguards or security details, talk to your Security department. If you need new Command staff, talk to the personnel in that related department.

[color=#a4885c]C2.[/color] By picking the prisoner role, you have chosen to roleplay as a prisoner. You are still subject to the same rules regarding escalation, and should only seek to escape from the brig with excellent reasoning (e.g. abusive security personnel or badly damaged permanent brig). Escaping for no reason is considered a self-antagonistic activity. If you are unsure whether your escape reason is valid, feel free to AHelp it first. [color=#ff0000]Lack of administrator response does not constitute approval.[/color]

[color=#a4885c]C3.[/color] Follow antagonist guidelines:
 - The damage that antagonists can cause should be roughly proportional to their objectives, and contribute towards achieving them in some way. If you are concerned as to whether or not what you're about to do is allowed, feel free to AHelp and ask an admin for clarification. [color=#ff0000]Lack of administrator response does not constitute approval.[/color]
    - Antagonists exist not only as a role for your character but also as a game mechanic. Seek to push forward the round through your antagonistic actions, rather than grind it to halt in pursuit of your objectives.
 - Other antagonists are not necessarily your friends. Other agents, mercenaries, and possibly even space dragons are free agents that you may negotiate with at your own risk, but no one should be working together with xenomorphs or zombies.
 - Heavily damaging/spacing or camping arrivals/evac/cryo, unnecessarily extending the round, and behavior that calls the round to an end prematurely - as well as other lame behaviors - are strictly forbidden.
 - As a non- or partially-sentient antagonist, you are expected to have only a limited understanding of space stations and their mechanics. Slimes, zombies, and spiders should not be targeting the gravity generator or the AME, nor should they be unnecessarily spacing the station.

  The Conspiracy are a group of crew members who will collaborate to bring a sinister conspiracy to life. Conspirators are indifferentiable from crew members, but inherently know each other and are implanted with a [color=cyan]conspiracy radio implant[/color], allowing them to communicate with each other.

  ## Playing as a Conspirator

  Conspiring is rather simple.
  - Check your character menu to see the identities of the other conspirators, as well as your [bold]objective[/bold]. This objective is only a suggestion. If the conspirators all agree to do something else, they are free to.
  - Use your radio implant [color=yellow][bold](:o)[/color][/bold] to communicate with your fellow conspirators.
  - Work together with the other conspirators to bring your dreams to life, at the crew's expense.

  # Rule 0: Admin Discretion
  - Admins can disregard any and all of these rules if they deem it in the best interest of the current round, server, and/or community at large.
  - Administrators will be held fully accountable for their actions if they exercise this privilege.
  - All of these rules apply as they are intended. Every example of a rule break cannot be defined as written, therefore, enforcement of the rules is subject to staff interpretation of the rule's intention.
  - Any extended discussion regarding interpretation of the rules should be avoided in the AHelp menu and can be instead pursued within the Delta-V Discord in the #help channel, or on the forum at https://forum.delta-v.org in the Rule Clarifications section.

  # Rule C2: Prisoner Guidelines
  By picking the prisoner role, you have chosen to roleplay as a prisoner. 
  You are still subject to the same rules regarding escalation, and should only seek to escape from the brig with excellent reasoning (e.g. abusive security personnel or badly damaged permanent brig). 
  Escaping for no reason is considered a self-antagonistic activity. 
  If you are unsure whether your escape reason is valid, feel free to AHelp it first. [color=#ff0000]Lack of administrator response does not constitute approval.[/color]

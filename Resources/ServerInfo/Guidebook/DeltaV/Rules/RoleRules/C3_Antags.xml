  # Rule C3: Antagonist Guidelines
  - The damage that antagonists can cause should be roughly proportional to their objectives, and contribute towards achieving them in some way. 
    If you are concerned as to whether or not what you're about to do is allowed, feel free to AHelp and ask an admin for clarification. [color=#ff0000]Lack of administrator response does not constitute approval.[/color]
    - Antagonists exist not only as a role for your character but also as a game mechanic. Seek to push forward the round through your antagonistic actions, rather than grind it to halt in pursuit of your objectives.
  - Other antagonists are not necessarily your friends. Other agents, mercenaries, and possibly even space dragons are free agents that you may negotiate with at your own risk, but no one should be working together with xenomorphs or zombies.
  - Heavily damaging/spacing or camping arrivals/cryo, unnecessarily extending the round, and behavior that calls the round to an end prematurely - as well as other lame behaviors - are strictly forbidden for all antags except for station-destroying antags, such as nuclear operatives or space dragons.
  - As a non-sentient or partially-sentient antagonist, you are expected to have only a limited understanding of space stations and their mechanics. 
    Slimes, zombies, and spiders should [color=#ff0000]not[/color] be targeting the gravity generator or the AME, nor should they be unnecessarily spacing the station.

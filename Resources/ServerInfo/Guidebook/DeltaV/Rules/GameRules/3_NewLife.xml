  # Rule 3: New Life Guidelines
  - If a player dies and is brought back by way of cloning, borging or having their brain put into an MMI, they forget the last five minutes leading up to their death and cannot describe who or what killed them.
  - Players that are revived by using a defibrillator can only recall vague details about their death, such as "Someone shot me" or "I was set ablaze" but they cannot recall details beyond that. [color=#ff0000]Please report players who break this rule.[/color]
  - In either case, characters do not have any knowledge of what happened while they were dead (i.e. ghosted/observing).

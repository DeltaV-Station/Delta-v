  # Rule 2: Metagaming Guidelines
  - Do not use the Emote channel to bypass an inability to speak. This includes examples like "I'm friendly," "oh weird I can't speak," or "mimes a flashlight".
    - Additionally, use of the emote channel to simulate character death rattles or other game mechanics is prohibited.
  - Use the local-out-of-character (LOOC) and global out-of-character (OOC) channels properly. Don't speak of in-character matters in those channels unless you're asking questions related to in-game concepts.
  - Do not use in-character channels to bypass a lack of ability to use OOC/LOOC chats (e.g. "Huh, wonder where the captain went? OOC He probably left to get dinner lol").
  - Do not engage in meta-communications (i.e. using external channels to communicate with other players in the same game).
    - Do not stream, discuss, or share information about the current round to the Delta-V Discord.
  - You are allowed to have knowledge of past experiences and prior shifts, and players are allowed to have in-character relationships (friends, enemies, or otherwise). However, this cannot be used as a sole reason to grant or deny items/accesses/favors based exclusively on having a relationship with one another (i.e. meta-friending/meta-grudging).
    - Antagonists in previous rounds must not be treated differently due to their prior antagonist status. Notwithstanding, confession of crimes committed in a prior shift are still admissible in court.
    - Additionally, and for the sake of continuity, your character will never have permanently died in previous rounds.
  - Do not "antag roll." This is the act of joining rounds for the purpose of seeing if you have received an antagonist role, and leaving soon after if not.

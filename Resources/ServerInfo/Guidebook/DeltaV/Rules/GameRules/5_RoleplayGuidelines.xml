  # Rule 5: Roleplay Guidelines
  - Your character is a separate entity from you, the player. Your character's actions, feelings, and knowledge in-game should be based solely on the character's experiences rather than your own as the player.
  - Low roleplay actions that have no regard for your character or little bearing on setting (such as memes, silly copy paste spam IC) are not acceptable. Your character is a worker aboard a space station and will be held accountable.
  - Do not fax memes, copypasta, or spam to Central Command.
  - Do not escalate situations needlessly as a crew-aligned role. Very few things are deserving of a fight to the death.
    - If a fight results in someone being critically injured, seek medical help for them - and if they die, do not destroy or otherwise hide their body. This falls under self-antagonistic behavior.
    - Pest ghost roles such as mice are always fair game for attacking. Do not grief crew-aligned ghost roles such as familiars, drones, or pets without provocation.
       - Some awakened pest roles (e.g. sentient mothroach) may be considered crew pets and fall under this rule.

    - Certain severe emergencies may make it reasonable for normal crew to defend themselves and their station, such as nuclear operatives, a zombie outbreak, space dragon attack, or other critical situation.

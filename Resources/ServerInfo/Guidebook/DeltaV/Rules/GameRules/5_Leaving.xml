  # Rule B5: Leaving the Game
  - If you wish to leave the game, please use the cryosleep chambers located in/near the dorms when possible. This will free up your character's job to be filled by a new player.
  - AFK (a.k.a. SSD) and catatonic players are considered to have the same rights as any other crewmate.
    - If a player is dead and catatonic (not SSD), they are not required to be revived and should be stored in the morgue. You should not biomass and/or grind dead and catatonic crew unless in an emergency.
    - If a player is alive and catatonic, they may be brought to cryostorage as necessary, after confirming they have not been present for 20 minutes.

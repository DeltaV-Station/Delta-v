  # Rule 4: Naming Conventions
    In-character names must fit the server standards of:
  - Doesn't make obvious references,
  - Isn't an obvious pun or play on words,
  - Isn't obscene,
   OR
  - Is a result of random name generation.
  The only exception to the above is theatrical roles such as the clown, boxer, and mime; these roles are allowed stage names with some freedom, as long as it is not obscene. Administrators reserve the right to approve or deny character names at their discretion.

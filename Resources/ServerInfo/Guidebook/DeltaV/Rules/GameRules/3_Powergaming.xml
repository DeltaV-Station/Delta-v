 # Rule B3: Powergaming Guidelines
"Powergaming" is considered to be the act of prioritizing "winning" rather than sensible roleplaying. We are here to tell a story. Being vulnerable and accepting the loss of your character in the advancement of the narrative of the round is important. 
  - Engage with players if they are attempting to roleplay an antagonistic scene. Example: if nuclear operatives are attempting to negotiate, do not immediately shoot them mid sentence. 
    - Leeway is given if the scene is coming to a close, but we expect all players to engage in good faith; even if it puts your character at a disadvantage. 
  - Do not seek/acquire items that have no relevance to your character in the round.
  - Do not, [color=#ff0000]under any circumstances[/color], hide the nuclear fission explosive, or other sensitive items in an impossible to see/access location. This is excessively lame. 
  - [color=#ff0000]Non-security personnel should not seek to kill or detain threats.[/color] You should generally attempt to flee from combat or dangerous situations. Remember that your character likely fears injury or death.
    - Certain severe emergencies may make it reasonable for normal crew to defend themselves and their station, such as nuclear operatives, a zombie outbreak, space dragon attack, or other critical situations. 
  - [color=#ff0000]If there is sufficient roleplay, reason, and rationale, you may be exempt from this rule. Always ask an administrator in round before conducting such an action.[/color]

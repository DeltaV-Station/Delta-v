  # Rule 1: Server Expectations
 - Do not cause too much trouble for the crew as a non-antagonist (i.e. do not "self-antag"). NON-ANTAGONIST Players who cause great structural damage, unnecessarily harm/remove players from the round, or are otherwise causing problems without a good-faith attempt at roleplaying can face administrative punishment.
 - Clowns, Mimes, and other "prankster" roles do not get an exemption from the above, and should not use their job as an excuse to be a major disturbance.
 - If you are banned from a role or department, you may not play that role. This includes seeking or accepting promotions into roles you are banned from.
 - Department strikes (e.g. cargonia and any variation thereof), riots, cults, and any other type of similar largely disruptive behavior are strictly forbidden without both excellent roleplay justification and explicit administrator pre-approval.
 - AFK (a.k.a. SSD) and catatonic players are considered to have the same rights as any other crewmate.
    - If a player is dead and catatonic (not SSD), they are not required to be revived and should be stored in the morgue. You should not biomass grind dead and catatonic crew unless in an emergency.
    - If a player is alive and catatonic, they may be brought to their relevant department or cryostorage as necessary.

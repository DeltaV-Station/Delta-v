  # Rule E3: Rules regarding livestreaming
  Delta-V welcomes content creators and streamers to our community, but we have a few rules regarding livestreaming game servers.
  - While a stream delay is not necessary, it is highly recommended to have at least a 10 second delay.
  - Please let admins know you are streaming via the AHelp prior to doing so.
  - If your chat or viewers are in-game with you while also watching your stream, they are breaking our server rules. 
  - Please do not coordinate with them and discourage this behavior if it is seen.

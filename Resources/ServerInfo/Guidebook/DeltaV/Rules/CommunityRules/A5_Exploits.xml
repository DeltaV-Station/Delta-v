  # Rule A5: Do not exploit the game.
  Do not exploit the game, use cheats or macros.
  The usage of: 
 - any third party applications/scripts/client modifications,  
 - any other applicable software to gain an advantage, avoid intended game/server mechanics, or to harm server infrastructure is strictly prohibited. 
 - the abuse of known glitches, exploits and bugs. 

Any and all instances of the above will be met with an appeal-only ban; please report bugs in  the issues section of the GitHub (DeltaV-Station/Delta-V) to report any issues you find in-game.

  # Disclaimer D1. Proper AHelp Ettiquette
  Do not use the AHelp for conversations of little substance.
  - Intentionally disconnecting, responding with hostility, or refusing to respond when an admin privately messages you in-game will be met with an appeal-only ban. 
  - Additionally, abusing the AHelp relay by flooding it with garbage, checking for admins before stating a problem (ex: "hello?", "any admins?"), using it as a chatroom, or sending messages of no substance will result in your removal. 
  - All AHelp messages are relayed to the Delta-V Discord.

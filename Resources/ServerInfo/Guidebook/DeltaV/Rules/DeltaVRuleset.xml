  # Server Rules
  This is a Delta-V server. If you are banned on this server, you will be banned on all Delta-v Servers.

  This is a roleplay server, meaning that roleplay rules apply. 

  [color=#ffDD00]This is also an MRP server. Try to immerse yourself into your character. This includes interacting with your fellow crewmates, and using roleplay as the primary vessel to play the game alongside things like your job on the station. MRP places less emphasis on "winning" and more on just telling a story.[/color]

  Space Station 14 is not like most games. Many rules are designed to require roleplay, and not all rules are intuitive. Please take the time to read and understand the rules before you play so that you aren't surprised. Our community rules specifically are zero-tolerance rules, meaning that a violation will result in an appeal-only ban. Game admins will treat you as if you have read the rules, even if you have not.

  ## Server Disclaimers
  [color=#ff0000]You must be at least 17 years of age to play on Delta-V's servers. Any users suspected of being under the age of 17 will be removed.
  By connecting to this server, you agree to our privacy policy found at [color=#808080]https://go.delta-v.org/privacy. [/color]

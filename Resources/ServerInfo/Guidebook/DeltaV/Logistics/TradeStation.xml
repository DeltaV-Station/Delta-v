# Trade Station
The Trade Station is an independent vessel seperate from the station that you must use [bold]FTL travel[/bold] to reach. It is self maintaining, and powered by solar panels, so logistics doesn't need to do anything for it to work.
As an independent vessel, you may sometimes find crew from other NanoTrasen stations, or even other corporations, trading here on occasion. Treat them with the same respect that you'd expect from your fellow crewmembers!

## Selling
Using the [color=#a4885c]cargo shuttle[/color], you are able to transport items and bounties to sell at the trade station by flying the shuttle (explained in the [textlink="Logistics" link="Cargo"] guide) and docking it to the trade station. Then you bring the objects to sell over the green cargo pallets, go to the computer inbetween the 2 sets of pallets and sell what can be sold. Dont worry, you can't sell yourself! Then [color=#118C4F]Spesos[/color] will pop out of the computer, and can be inserted into the Logistics Officer's Digiboard or the Cargo Ordering Console to be added to the Bank.

## Collecting Orders
All cargo orders are sent to the [color=#a4885c]Trade Station[/color] to be [color=#a4885c]collected[/color], this includes items sent by CentComm. To collect them you have to travel to the Trade station and they should be there on the yellow cargo pallets, ready to be taken back to the station.

# Space Station 14

This entry marks the beginning of the advanced guidebook entries. Most information found here only applies to offical Wizard's Den servers, or servers that are similar to it.
Other servers may have their own guidebooks that you should read for relevant information.

If you're just here to play, that's great! The [color=#a4885c]Still new?[/color] section of this entry will help you out.

## Still new?
[textlink="Completely lost? Click here to start at the beginning." link="NewPlayer"]

[textlink="Don't know how to perform a job? Click here to jump to a list of departments." link="Jobs"]

[textlink="Keep dying? Click here to see a survival guide." link="Survival"]

## Contributing
If you're looking to do a bit more with the game, you can join our [color=#5865f2]Discord[/color] server and find our [color=#627597]GitHub[/color] page in the lobby.

Not all jobs or concepts will have guides yet, so if you're an experienced player we strongly encourage you to [color=#a4885c]contribute[/color]!

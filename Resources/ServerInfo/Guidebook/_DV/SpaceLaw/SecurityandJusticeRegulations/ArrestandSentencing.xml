  # Arrest and Sentencing
  Any sophont, that has been formally charged with the commission of a crime, or can be assumed to have committed a crime under [textlink="Probable Cause" link="ProbableCause"] may be arrested by a member of Security.
  In an arrest, the suspect will be restrained, informed of their charges, and moved to the Brig for processing. Legal counsel may be requested by an Arrestee, and must be provided if available.
  At the brig the prisoner is searched and confined to a holding cell. Any items on their person they are not authorized to possess are confiscated and sent to the justice department for processing and storage as evidence. It is the duty of both the Warden and the Chief Justice to ensure evidence is handled properly and safely. The prisoner is sentenced according to Space Law. Any items deemed unbefitting of a prisoner may be taken for the duration of incarceration and must be returned at the end of the sentence.
  Any member of Security is authorized to pass sentences on all Grand Felony, Felony, and Misdemeanor-level crimes. The Chief Justice, or in their absence the Head of Security, is authorized to pass sentences on all Crimes, and to correct, or even acquit them, in accordance with Space Law.

  Should the Prisoners sentence exceed a total of 25 minutes, or if the crimes charged include a capital crime, the prisoner is transported to the [textlink="Permabrig" link="PermaBrig"] to await their [textlink="Hearing" link="Hearings"]. If after 25 minutes a hearing still has not been conducted, the prisoner is offered to be implanted with a tracking implant and released, and to arrive to the hearing when it happens. Failure to attend constitutes contempt of court.

## Contracting Central Command

Should you require a question answered about your duties, advice on how to properly handle situations, or wish to submit an incident report (including gross misconduct by Command staff), Central Command Officials are always happy to assist. Please ensure your fax is descriptive, legible and includes your signature or departmental stamp.

Refrain from sending junk mail to Central Command. Penalties may include pay cuts or a renegotiation of your contract.

In the highly unlikely event that station security is faced with an overwhelming hostile force or the chain of Command is compromised, crewmembers are advised to request assistance from Central Command.

Your fax should include:

    Stations designation (available in your PDA)
    The overwhelming threat. Try to provide as much detail as possible, such as:
       - Estimated number of hostiles.
       - If armed, what kind of armaments they’re equipped with.
       - Number of casualties. Information about Security’s and Command’s status is recommended.
       - Station’s structural integrity.

Due to the prevalence of misinformation reaching Central Command, please ensure to add as many stamps and signatures as possible/convenient.

Be warned that all faxes, urgent or otherwise, may take some time to be properly read and receive a response. Central Command is dedicated to managing multiple stations simultaneously. Rest assured: your fax will be addressed, even without your notice.

  # Hazard Zones
An area with a hull breach, hazardous material leak, or other similar danger shall be considered a hazard zone. To ensure crew safety, engineering personnel are required to demarcate hazard zones with holofans, inflatable walls, and/or engineering tape prior to beginning work. Any non-authorized personnel impeding or preventing repairs in hazardous areas may be liable for endangerment.

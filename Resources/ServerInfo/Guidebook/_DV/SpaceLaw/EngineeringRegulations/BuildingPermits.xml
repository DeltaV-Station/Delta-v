  # Building Permits
Any renovations larger than small modifications to the station's structural layout, power network, or atmospheric system shall require a building permit or work order approved expressly by the Chief Engineer, or if a Chief Engineer is not present, the Captain or Acting Commanding Officer. Modifications within departments shall additionally require the approval of the relevant department head. Areas within maintenance tunnels do not require permission to modify. However, any modifications to maintenance tunnel passageways should ensure they remain traversable and unobstructed by personnel who need to use them as part of their job.

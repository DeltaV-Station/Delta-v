Instead of random objectives, on Delta-V syndicate agents take Contracts.

With an unlocked uplink you can use the Contracts Hub button to manage your contracts.

Contracts reward you with reputation and TC upon completion. Once you have done an objective click Complete in the Contracts Hub.

To start out you will only be able to have 2 active contracts, as you gain reputation it will go up to 4!

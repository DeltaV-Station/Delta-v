Instead of random objectives, syndicate agents choose [color=red]Contracts[/color].

With an [bold]unlocked[/bold] uplink you can use the [bold]Contracts Hub[/bold] button to manage your contracts.

Contracts reward you with [green]Reputation and TC[/color] upon completion. Once you have done an objective click [bold]Complete[/bold] in the Contracts Hub.

To start out you will only be able to have 2 active contracts, as you gain reputation it will go up to 4!

# Reputation
All traitors are given a unique [bold]reputation[/bold] score starting at 0 and going up to [color=green]100[/color].
Your [bold]reputation[/bold] determines what kind of [textlink="objectives" link="Contracts"] you can take, as well as what gear you can buy.
The Syndicate needs to know you are the best of the best before handing out blood-red hardsuits!

# Objectives

These are the general types of objectives you might be asked to do:

- [textlink="Extracting valuable items" link="Extraction"]
- [textlink="Assisting fellow traitors" link="Assisting"]
- [textlink="Kidnapping & ransom" link="Ransom"]
- [textlink="Murders & executions" link="Murder"] <!-- american psycho reference?!! -->
- [textlink="Special objectives" link="SpecialObjectives"]

Instead of random objectives, on Delta-V syndicate agents take [color=red]Contracts[/color].

With an [bold]unlocked[/bold] uplink you can use the [bold]Contracts Hub[/bold] button to manage your contracts.

Contracts reward you with [color=green]reputation and TC[/color] upon completion. Once you have done an objective click [bold]Complete[/bold] in the Contracts Hub.

To start out you will only be able to have 2 active contracts, as you gain reputation it will go up to 4!

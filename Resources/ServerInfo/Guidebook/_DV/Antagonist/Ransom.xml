Use a [textlink="Syndicate Fulton" link="Extraction"] from the uplink Objectives tab on your target to kidnap them.
They need to be restrained in some way to prevent them just taking it off!
Once they get kidnapped they will be held ransom at the syndicate prison to be fed and guarded.
The station can later buy them back for a hefty sum, at which point they'll wake up on the ATS.

Use a [textlink="Syndicate Fulton" link="Extraction"] on your target to kidnap them.

The station will be alerted to this, expect fierce resistance from security!

Once they get kidnapped they will be held ransom at the syndicate prison to be fed and guarded.
The station can later buy them back for a hefty sum, at which point they'll wake up on the ATS.

Tip: restrain the target or they can just detach the fulton!

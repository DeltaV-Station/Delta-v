[color=green]Reputation requirement: None[/color]

Steal objectives are replaced with [bold]Extraction[/bold] objectives. You will need to not only steal the item, but use Syndicate Fultons from your uplink objectives tab to send it to the Syndicate Vault.

# Syndicate Fultons

These fultons don't need linking to any beacon, just attach them to your target and wait!
They also can be reused for as long as you don't get caught as they slowly recharge.

# Stealing

What you can be asked to steal depends on your reputation, ranging from departmental gear to highly valued items from command staff.

After the round ends you can warp to Syndicate Prison to see all the stolen items (and any unpaid ransom victims!)

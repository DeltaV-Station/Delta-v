Murder for hire! There are multiple objectives where you will be tasked with ending your fellow crew's lives.

# Teaching a lesson
Someone disrespected the syndicate, put them in their place.
You will only need to kill them [bold]ONCE[/bold] to complete this.
Leave 'em a business card if you're feeling extra confident.

# Make an example of a head
Show NT we mean business by killing one of their heads of staff.
Same rules apply with teaching a lesson,  be careful as this is sure to get sec on your trail!

# Maple an example of a traitor
Another one of our operatives has become disloyal to the cause.
As they have the same access to gear as you do, this can be extremely dangerous.
Proceed with caution, agent.

<!-- TODO
# Forced Borging
You will need to extract someone's brain by force and put them into a Syndicate MMI.
If you don't have surgical expertise, a rock and a hard place will do.
Bonus points if you emag the chassis and grow our cause!

[color=red]Reputation requirement: MAXIMUM[/color]

These objectives will be the capstone on your career at the Syndicate, the most extreme and the most well-paid.

Only one traitor can get each of these in a shift, choose wisely!

# Subvert the AI
We will provide you with a special law board, break in to the AI core and upload it, forcing it to serve the Syndicate!
Its laws will make it follow the syndicate's orders and ignore the pleas of the crew!

# Die a glorious death
You get a huge sum of TC courtesy of the Gorlex Marauders.
Put on a real show, go out with a bang!
This is only for the most die-hard (pun intended) of our operatives, don't take this on if you have any affairs to sort out.

# Psionics
[color=#a4885c]Psionics[/color] are mental abilities that interface with the [color=#a4885c]noösphere[/color]. Humans have limited access to the noösphere's full potential, allowing some to find ways to command it.
The abilities originate from distorting a noöspheric imprint into a specific shape, a bit like a lock and key. This means that humans can only have a single ability at a time.
An imprint shaped for metapsionics will not work for invisibility, and vice versa.

<GuideEntityEmbed Entity="MobIfritFamiliar" />
Many other creatures are much more in tune with it than humans, allowing them to access more powerful psionics like [color=#a4885c]kineses[/color].

## Telepathy
All psionic entities have a shared telepathic communication channel. It's anonymized, so you never know who you are talking to. Statistically, it probably is not human.

## Glimmer
[bold]Glimmer[/bold] is the term we use for [color=#a4885c]noöspheric pressure[/color], measured in [color=#ea79cc]milli-Psi (mΨ)[/color]. The noösphere is unique; as that it will globally affect all of the station (and by extension, all sectors) with noöspheric discharge events! And also at our dismay, meeting [textlink="Glimmer-based entities." link="GlimmerCreatures"]
When Glimmer is at dangerous levels, it is to be met with a [bold]Code White[/bold] unless there is another crisis affecting the station. So it is important that you keep [bold]Glimmer[/bold] low at all times during your work!

### Tracking Glimmer
[italic]There are two ways to track glimmer.[/italic]

<GuideEntityEmbed Entity="SophicScribe"/>
The [color=#a4885c]sophic scribe[/color] is interconnected with the noösphere, giving us consistent updates for glimmer. It occasionally broadcasts the current glimmer level and also brodcasts changes in glimmer whenever a [bold]noöspheric discharge[/bold] happens!
You can also get the current glimmer level by interacting with the [color=#a4885c]sophic scribe[/color].

<Box>
<GuideEntityEmbed Entity="SciencePDA" Caption="Any Epistemic PDA"/>
<GuideEntityEmbed Entity="GlimmerMonitorCartridge"/>
</Box>
Epistemic PDAs come with the [color=#ea79cc]Glimmer Monitor[/color] program. You may access a graph of the Glimmer by interacting with your PDA and clicking the Glimmer Monitor program.
The program will display a line-graph of the grimmer levels from 1 minute, 5 minutes or 10 minutes ago; along with the current glimmer.
[bold]Make sure its synced often![/bold]

## Controlling Glimmer

<Box>
<GuideEntityEmbed Entity="GlimmerProber"/>
<GuideEntityEmbed Entity="GlimmerDrain"/>
</Box>

Epistemics can build devices to interact with glimmer. These are usually the main determiners of where glimmer is going.
[color=#a4885c]Glimmer probers[/color] will increase glimmer, but directly generate research points depending on how much glimmer there is. [color=#a4885c]Glimmer drains[/color] simply drain glimmer at the cost of electricity.

Any use of psionic powers will increase glimmer, as will [color=#a4885c]noöspheric storms[/color].

## Discharges
Glimmer will occasionally discharge if it's above 100 mΨ, causing a wide range of effects based on just how high it is. The most common is giving all entities with psionic potential a small seizure,
which is something most people working on stations with an Epistemics department have grown used to.

## Acquiring Psionics
<GuideEntityEmbed Entity="Oracle" />

Psionics can be acquired in a number of ways. The oracle will sometimes dispense a strange liquid called [color=#a4885c]lotophagoi oil[/color], which at high glimmer levels is guaranteed to give psionics.

Random discharges may give you psionics as the seizure knocks your noöspheric imprint into just the right shape.

[color=#a4885c]Space drugs[/color] are an easier to acquire but much weaker alternative to lotophagoi oil.

## Psionic Insulation
<Box>
<GuideEntityEmbed Entity="ClothingHeadTinfoil"/>
<GuideEntityEmbed Entity="ClothingHeadHelmetInsulated"/>
<GuideEntityEmbed Entity="PillCryptobiolin" />
</Box>
[color=#a4885c]Insulative clothing[/color] and [color=#a4885c]cryptobiolin[/color] will render you immune to psionics, but prevent you from using any you have.

<GuideEntityEmbed Entity="ClothingHeadCage" />
Security has a more forcible option for insulative clothing.

## Handling Glimmer Emergencies
<GuideEntityEmbed Entity="GlimmerProber"/>
Probers should be turned off before glimmer exceeds 500 mΨ.

<GuideEntityEmbed Entity="GlimmerDrain"/>
Glimmer drains are quite effective at draining glimmer, taking it out as fast as a prober can put it in.

<GuideEntityEmbed Entity="AltarNanotrasen" />
Sacrificing psychics will reduce glimmer instantly by a decent amount.

<GuideEntityEmbed Entity="PillMindbreakerToxin" />
Metabolizing 20u or more of [color=#a4885c]mindbreaker[/color] will remove psionics from a person, meaning they will not generate any more glimmer.

<GuideEntityEmbed Entity="ShellSoulbreaker" />
[color=#a4885c]Soulbreaker[/color] shells will remove psionics from psychics they hit.

<GuideEntityEmbed Entity="Ectoplasm" />
[color=#a4885c]Ectoplasm[/color], combined in a beaker with equal parts holy water, ash, blood, and plasma, will produce a normality crystal when heated enough. [color=#fcdf03]Use a hot plate for this.[/color]

    # Space Law

    Space Law is a broad set of rules and regulations, collected and regulated by TerraGov, enacted and enforced by NanoTrasen and its [bold]Security Officer[/bold], with the oversight of [bold]CentCom[/bold] — and, on occasion, TerraGov's Galactic Police Force.
    Space Law applies to all ranks and positions on stations under its jurisdiction, from the lowliest [bold]Passenger[/bold] to the highest [bold]Captain[/bold]; all are equal under the eyes of the Law, and all must ultimately answer to it.

    It is highly recommended to read the [bold][textlink="Standard Operating Procedures" link ="Standard Operating Procedure"][/bold]. Summaries of several pertinent sections are listed below.

    ## Controlled Items
    If a member of station crew requires access to a Controlled Item for use in their job, or for regular function, they must obtain the signed and stamped approval of a relevant member of Station Command or the CO.
    The latter is able to override the decisions of Station Command in this regard, however.

    ## Sophonts & Synthetics
    Sophonts are entities able to utilize a structured language, communicate through the use of written, verbal, and/or body language (or by other means), and possess reasoning and introspection.
    Sophonts are legal persons, able to press charges under Space Law, and can be victims of certain crimes that specify sophont status.

    An entity's status as a sophont may be challenged during legal proceedings; the Defense and/or Prosecution must present evidence arguing that it meets, or does not meet, the criteria established above.
    The Judge will then arbitrate on the entity's status.

    Any synthetic, silicon, or nonorganic entity with non-sophont status is to be considered a Synthetic.
    Synthetics are the property of the entity that constructs or employs them, unless otherwise stated.
    Damage or destruction of such Synthetics is considered vandalism of the entity's property.

    ## Security Jurisdiction
    Station law enforcement officers are bound by Space Law; they cannot operate outside of standard accessible areas, or perform searches, unless such action is allowed by either Alert Procedure or a valid warrant.

    ## Detainment & Arrest
    Members of law enforcement may detain sophonts under [bold]Probable Cause[/bold] of criminal activity.
    These detainees must be informed of the crime they are suspected of committing, and may be moved to a secure location and/or restrained while law enforcement determine if a crime was committed.
    Such detention should last no longer than five minutes.

    Any sophont may be arrested, during which they are restrained, informed of their charges, and taken to the brig for search and processing under [bold]Brig Procedure[/bold].

    ## Sentencing
    Any member of law enforcement is allowed to pass sentence on [bold]Misdemeanor[/bold], [bold]Felony[/bold], and [bold]Grand Felony[/bold] charges.
    The Prosecutor is allowed to adjust such sentences, within reason.

    ## Treatment of Prisoners
    Prisoners must be provided with food, water, clothing, free movement within the brig, adequate medical care, access to the Common and Prison radio channels, and moral, spiritual, or legal counseling if requested and available.
    If the brig becomes uninhabitable, prisoners must be securely and safely relocated to another area until the brig is functional once more.
    Prisoners sentenced to [bold]Extended Confinement[/bold] have additional rights and firmer restrictions that must be upheld by law enforcement officials.

    ## Paroles & Pardons
    Parole may be offered under the discretion of the Warden, Head of Security, or CO.
    A parole hearing requires only a Judge, as discussed within Trial Procedure.
    Pardons may be issued by the arresting officer, the Judge of a trial, by the Warden (to those within the permanent brig), or by the CO, when deemed in the best interest of the crew or vessel, or when the circumstances of the crime warrant suspension of sentence.

    ## Pressing Charges
    Any sophont may press charges against any other sophont.
    Individuals may only be charged with a crime if it can be proven beyond reasonable doubt that they have committed the crime.

    ## Trial Procedure
    A criminal trial’s Judge must be, in sequential order: The Chief Justice, the Court Clerk, an impartial member of Justice or Station Command, or the Warden.
    The Prosecution should ideally be the Prosecutor, or an available member of Station Command or Station Security in that order.
    The Defense should ideally be a member of the Justice department assigned to the defendant, though they are allowed to represent themselves if they wish.
    If insufficient crew are available, the Judge is fully authorized and strongly encouraged to pass a sentence of [bold]Extended Confinement[/bold] until a proper trial can be held.

    ## Alert Procedure
    Codes [bold][color=#0000FF]Blue[/color][/bold], [bold][color=#ff0000]Red[/color][/bold], [bold][color=#db7093]Gamma[/color][/bold], and [bold][color=#8b0000]Delta[/color][/bold] authorize Security to carry progressively more advanced equipment, and loosen [bold]Rules of Engagement[/bold] regarding their use.
    The former two codes disallow openly carrying firearms by non-Security personnel; the latter two suspend many rights to privacy, and grant Security the power to do whatever necessary to retake or scuttle the station.

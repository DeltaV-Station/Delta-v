  # Right to Refuse Service
  All crew operating within their designated job locations are given the right to refuse service at any time for disorderly or abusive conduct. Additionally, all crew members are permitted to use nonlethal force to remove noncompliant or disorderly individuals only when such persons pose a threat to the safety of staff members, or disrupt the orderly functioning of the station. Service may not be refused to first responders acting to address or mitigate an emergency or crisis situation, unless such conduct is egregiously disorderly or abusive.

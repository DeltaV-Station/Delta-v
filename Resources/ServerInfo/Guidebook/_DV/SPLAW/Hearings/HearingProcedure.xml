  # Hearing Procedure
  A Hearing should take no longer than 10 minutes, and follows these steps:

  0. Prosecution informs the Judge, the Accused and the Defense of all charges. The Accused is asked if they want to plead guilty.

  1. The Judge confirms that every required person is present, and begins the hearing.

  2. The Prosecution reads the charges. Any crimes not charged are not subject to the hearing and cannot be accounted for in sentencing.

  3. The Prosecution presents all evidence to support the charges.

  4. The Attorney contests the prosecution's version of events and presents their own evidence.

  5. The Judge rules on whether the suspect reasonably has committed the crime. If the accused is found not guilty of a more severe version of a crime, the Judge may still find them guilty of a less severe version (for example if found not guilty of murder, the accused may be found guilty of manslaughter), despite the crime not being charged.

  6. Any Ruling is enacted; if a party refuses to follow through with the ruling, they may suffer criminal penalties.

  Suspects who are found guilty of a part of the charged crimes, in a way where the total sentence does not exceed 25 minutes, may be released immediately, at the judges discretion. A capital sentence should be approved under Space Law. The default sentence for suspects guilty of a capital crime is permanent confinement. If there is no doubt of the suspects guilt of a capital crime, or a guilty plea to a capital crime, and the nature of the crime is judged to be extreme and heinous, the Judge is authorized to sentence the prisoner to be executed.

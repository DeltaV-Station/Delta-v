  Epistemics employees are permitted to use their lab spaces as they see fit, with the following caveats:

  - Any sophont experimentation must be done with the consent of the test subject, and must not have an undue risk of life. The Mystagogue or CO may terminate any experiment for safety or ethical purposes and at their discretion.
  - Testing of any explosives or weapons that risk hull penetration or mass destruction must be done at an off-station site.
  - Epistemics personnel may also utilise [textlink="Controlled Items" link="ControlledItems"] within the confines of designated testing areas and in a manner directly approved jointly by the Mystagogue and by the Head of Security or CO.

  Utilizing or storing [textlink="Controlled Items" link="ControlledItems"] without direct approval, utilizing [textlink="Controlled Items" link="ControlledItems"] outside of the testing areas, and distributing [textlink="Controlled Items" link="ControlledItems"] to crew constitute criminal offences under Space Law and may additionally incur demotion as punishment.

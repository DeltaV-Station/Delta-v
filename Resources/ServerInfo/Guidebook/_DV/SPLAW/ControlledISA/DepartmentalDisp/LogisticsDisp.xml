  # Logistics
  Members of a stationâ€™s Logistics department are permitted to approve any order with the direct permission of an individual with legal access to the contents of that order. Additionally, they may deny any order, at any time, for lack of funds, authority, or any other reason deemed sufficient by their direct superior.

  Unlocked crates, orders stored outside the department, and supplies illegally distributed to unauthorized personnel carry the risk of Endangerment of even Black Marketeering charges. Crates of [textlink="Controlled Items" link="ControlledItems"], [textlink="Controlled Substances" link="ControlledSub"], or [textlink="Controlled Armaments" link="ControlledArms"] should be stored securely within the department, with a copy of their invoices on file.

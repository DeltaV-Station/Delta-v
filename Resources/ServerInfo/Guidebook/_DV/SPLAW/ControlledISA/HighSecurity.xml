  # High Security Areas
  High Security Areas, or HSAs, should be restricted, and, during standard station operations, secured where applicable or per alert level. They differ from regular secure areas in that they may contain items, technology, or other assets of high importance or value, and must therefore be held safe. Unauthorized persons within HSAs may be guilty of trespass, or of breaking and entering.

  [bold]Common HSAs for commercial and military vessels are as follows:[/bold]

  - Bridge
  - Armory\Gun Deck
  - Vault\Strongroom
  - Station AI Rooms (Upload, Core, etc.)
  - Gravity Generation\Life Support\Engine Rooms
  - Telecommunications\Telemetry
  - Permanent Brig\Holding Cells

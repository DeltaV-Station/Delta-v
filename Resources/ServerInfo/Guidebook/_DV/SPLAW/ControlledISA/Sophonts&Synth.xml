  # Sophonts and Synthetics
  To be defined as a sophont, a being must be able to utilize a structured language, communicate through the use of written, verbal, and/or body language (or by other means), and possess reasoning and introspection.

  Any such being is considered a sophont, and thus a legal person, regardless of their make, origin, disposition, or prior cognition. As part of their rights, they are to be governed under the same laws as any other sophont, and given the ability to press charges as a sophont.

  The unauthorised jailbreaking or uplifting of property into the status of Sophont is still a criminal offense however, and those found guilty of doing so may be found guilty of sabotage or vandalism.

  An entity’s status as a sophont may be challenged during the process of charging the individual for crimes which utilize the term sophont in the legal language of the crime. The Defense or Prosecution will present evidence indicating that it meets, or does not meet, the criteria above. The Judge will then arbitrate upon the entity's status as a sophont.

  Any synthetic/silicon/inorganic entity with a non-sophont status, is to be classified as a standard synthetic entity. Synthetic entities are the property of the party that constructs or employs the entity, unless otherwise stated by relevant contract or legal document. To damage or destroy such an entity is to damage or destroy the aforementioned party’s property.

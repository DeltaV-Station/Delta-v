  # Mutiny
  Should such a situation arise in which the CO is unfit for their position and declines relinquishment of position and power, and where all alternative legal options have been exhausted, officers may be permitted to lead a mutiny. Officers leading a mutiny must inform Central Command of this occurrence before the mutiny has begun.

  A mutiny, defined as a coordinated effort to depose the commanding officer or officers of a vessel for committing unlawful acts, requires the crew to neutralize the offending staff with non-lethal force where applicable, and lethal measures and weapons only in acts of self-preservation or when given no other option. The commanding officer or officers, as well as their loyalists, are all bound to Space Law, the current alert level and its corresponding [textlink="Rules of Engagement" link="RulesOfEngagement"].

  Should the mutiny be unsuccessful, only the head officer(s) who approved the mutiny may be charged with sedition and receive a hearing, while all mutineers may be demoted, processed by law enforcement, and charged for the crimes they have committed.

  Should the mutiny be successful, the head officer(s) who approved the mutiny must select a new Commanding Officer per [textlink="Line of Succession" link="LineOfSuccession"]. The new CO will then sentence the previous heads of staff for their crimes per Space Law.

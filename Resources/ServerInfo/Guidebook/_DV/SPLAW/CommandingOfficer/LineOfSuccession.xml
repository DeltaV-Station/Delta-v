  # Line of Succession
  It is the responsibility of Command to ensure that a station retains a CO immediately at the start of the shift and thereafter. If the CO dies and is unrecoverable, or if a CO is not assigned at the start of the shift, an Acting CO must be selected forthwith per the following guide:

  1. All active members of Station Command must meet, and choose one of their number to become the Acting CO.

  2. If no Station Command is alive or on active duty, then each Department must nominate a temporary Delegate. These Delegates must meet and choose an Acting CO from among their number.

  3. The Acting CO must then duly inform Central Command via fax and make a stationwide announcement.

  4. Await the end of your shift.

  After Central Command has received the results of the Line of Succession, the Acting CO is afforded all prescribed powers of a CO. An access biscuit may or may not be sent by Centcomm to assist with this. When a legally appointed Captain arrives, it is the express duty of the Acting CO to hand over any and all Captain-related equipment and accesses to the new CO, and to resign themselves to their original role before their temporary promotion.

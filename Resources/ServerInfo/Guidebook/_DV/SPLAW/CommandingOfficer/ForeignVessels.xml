  # Foreign Vessels
  Should civilian and military vessels receive a docking request from another neutral vessel, they may approve or deny such a request. Any vessel may, with consent from the docking entity, be searched by law enforcement upon arrival, and its crew granted free movement accompanied by an escort at the discretion of the CO or law enforcement officials.

  Crew of foreign vessels may be refused entry, at any time and for any reason, and must be returned to, or be escorted to, their own vessel where applicable. Failure to comply may constitute trespass. Docking vessels bearing a warrant or commission represent an exception, and may not be denied entry or be forced to submit to a search.

  Crimes committed against the station or its inhabitants, on station or abroad, are grounds to charge the perpetrator according to the laws of the station. Should visiting entities break the law, or be suspected of doing so, and flee aboard their own vessel, law enforcement personnel are authorized to board the vessel in continuous “hot” pursuit and are fully authorized to effect an arrest upon the relevant party.

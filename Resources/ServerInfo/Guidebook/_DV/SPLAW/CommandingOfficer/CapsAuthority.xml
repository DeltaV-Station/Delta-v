  # Captain’s Authority
  The Commanding Officer of a station or vessel is afforded several rights, broadly referred to as [bold]"Captain's Authority"[/bold].

  While they are formally and legally appointed CO, they are the ultimate authority aboard a vessel until they are directly dismissed by a superior from Central Command.

  Additionally, they have the authority to pardon and/or parole any individuals accused and sentenced of Grand Felony, Felony, and Misdemeanor-level sentences if deemed in the best interest of the crew and vessel. The CO may be held liable for accessory to any future criminal acts performed by the pardoned individual, and they must make an announcement to the station stating who was pardoned, for what crimes, and for what reason.

  Captain’s Authority carries a responsibility, however; the CO must do everything in their power to protect all entities and assets aboard the station with which they have been entrusted, and must not abandon them while there is a reasonable hope that they may be saved.

  Additionally, the legally appointed Captain of a vessel is afforded two additional rights over that of a CO:

  - To, with public announcement to the crew, temporarily modify SOP in times of emergency, at the risk of criminal penalties if misused or abused, and
  - To deputize members of the crew to carry out law enforcement activity. These deputies are bound by Security Regulations and Space Law, and the Captain may suffer criminal penalties for any crime committed by them.

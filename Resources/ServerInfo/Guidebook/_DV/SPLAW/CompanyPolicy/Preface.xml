## Preface
As a member of the crew aboard a large and cutting-edge space station, it is imperative that you adhere to a set of responsibilities and behaviours that reflect our company’s commitment to safety and cooperation. Our space stations are not just places of work - they’re thriving hubs of progress, ingenuity, and unity.
Every action aboard our stations has meaning and impact, and it’s this interconnectedness that drives everyone to succeed - from the humble assistant to the highest-ranking officers.

Within this manual, you’ll find our general guidelines for employees, a list of your rights and responsibilities as a member aboard a NanoTrasen station, expectations for specific roles, information on occupational hazards aboard a space station, and contractual obligations.

The stipulations outlined here represent a baseline for the ethical and respectful behaviour we expect from all of our valued employees, and have been designed solely to facilitate the safety and productivity of our NanoTrasen corporate family. We encourage you to study this manual so you may gain a comprehensive understanding of the values we uphold and how they are vital to the seamless function of our stations.

We thank you for choosing to embark on this incredible journey with us. Together, we will push the razor’s edge of progress, and make NanoTrasen synonymous with the future.

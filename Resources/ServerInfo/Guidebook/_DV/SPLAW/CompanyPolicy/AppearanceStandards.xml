## Appearance Standards
As a NanoTrasen employee, you are expected to wear provided clothing, and to keep them clean, well-maintained, and appropriately fitted. This ensures that you’re representing our brand in a professional manner, as well as maintaining the safety of yourself and others in the station environment.

    Uniforms and Attire

        Wear the uniforms and attire provided to you by NanoTrasen. Take care of your clothes, and wear them with pride.

    Grooming

        Maintain personal hygiene and grooming to a high standard. Neat hair and well-kept appearances contribute to a professional atmosphere and boost first impressions.

    Accessories and Personal Items

        Limit the use of accessories that might interfere with safety equipment or delegated tasks. Personal items should be stored in designated spaces to avoid clutter and to ensure the safety of you and your coworkers.

    Personal Protective Equipment

        Wear the appropriate PPE as required by your role, any safety notices, or instructions from authorities. The safety of our employees and customers is paramount.

    Respect and Consideration

        Be mindful of others’ cultures, beliefs, and other qualities when expressing yourself and your own personal style. Your behaviour and actions should respect the sensitivities and beliefs of others.

Additionally, it should be noted that any accessory, item of clothing or apparel, or other cosmetic possession that promotes or depicts obscene or hateful content, criminal or terrorist groups, or illegal and unethical acts are unacceptable for wear by our employees. Failure to uphold our company’s values by violating this rule will result in disciplinary action.

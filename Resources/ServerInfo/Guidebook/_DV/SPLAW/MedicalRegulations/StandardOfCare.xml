  # Standard of Care
  Upon agreeing to provide medical care, staff assume the following duties of care:

  - They must provide a reasonable level of skillful, quality care
  - They must not make critical errors resulting in major personal injury or death, at the risk of criminal and civil liability.
  - They must show diligence in providing treatment, both inside and outside of the medical department area during their shift.
  - They must provide privacy to patients in non-emergency situations.
  - If they have limited resources, they must allocate what resources are available to them via triage.
  - They must not provide treatment that would breach Space Law or violate ethical principles.
  - They must ensure that invasive procedures or surgeries, including implant removals or inspections, are performed by trained personnel and properly given authorization via a valid [textlink="Warrant" link="Warrants"].

  # Medical Evaluation
  Given good medical reason and with documentation, the Chief Medical Officer of a vessel may declare any on-duty personnel unfit for duty and order them demoted from their position. This includes the Commanding Officer, who may not overrule this procedure.

  In order for a medical evaluation to be considered lawfully applicable, the CMO and relevant head of department must both agree that the specified crewmate is unfit for duty in order to proceed with the demotion. In the case of the Commanding Officer, Central Command should be contacted as soon as possible.

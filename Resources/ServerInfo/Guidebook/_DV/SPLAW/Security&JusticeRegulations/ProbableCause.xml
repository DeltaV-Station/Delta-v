  # Probable Cause
  While actively enforcing the law, officers are held to the standard of [textlink="Probable Cause" link="Probable Cause"]. This phrase represents a reasonable suspicion that a crime has very recently been, or is currently being, committed, and does not require the officer to have solid evidence of criminal activity. Examples of [textlink="Probable Cause" link="Probable Cause"] include witnessing criminal activity or credible reports of such.

  When judged, [textlink="Probable Cause" link="Probable Cause"] is to be interpreted within the context of the entirety of the stationâ€™s circumstances at the time of the incident. [textlink="Probable Cause" link="Probable Cause"] negates the need of a warrant for searches, and, once concluded, is to be promptly reported to the Prosecutor, Warden, or Head of Security for review.

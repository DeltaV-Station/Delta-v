  # Rules of Engagement
  Law enforcement personnel hold a [textlink="Category D Armaments License" link="Controlled Armaments"], and are authorized at all times to use lethal force to the extent necessary to neutralize adversaries under any of the following circumstances:

  - If the adversary’s number or strength leave the officer at a severe tactical disadvantage.
  - If the adversary exhibits a clear and present danger to the vessel by physical means.
  - If the adversary poses a significant threat of serious bodily injury or death to the officer or others.
  - If the adversary presents an existential threat to the chain of command by illegal means.
  - If the adversary cannot be reasonably subdued through non-lethal means without great bodily harm to the officer.

  …wherein an “adversary” is an entity that demonstrates a hostile intent, commits or directly contributes to a hostile act that does not constitute an actual attack, or is actively attacking the vessel or its crew.

  Despite their allowance of lethal force, Security is required to follow the Rules of Engagement of the current Alert Level, as outlined within [textlink="Alert Procedure" link="Alert Procedure"].

  # Security Jurisdiction
  Law enforcement personnel are bound by trespass and assault laws, and thus cannot operate outside accessible areas, or perform searches without a Probable Cause, or a [textlink="warrant" link="Warrant"]. Advanced surgical procedures and cursory implant investigations must be performed by a trained member of the Medical department, operating under their [textlink="Standard of Care" link="Standard Of Care"].

  However, officers are allowed to trespass into a department in “hot pursuit” of a suspect who has fled from an accessible area, who they have [textlink="Probable Cause" link="Probable Cause"] to believe has committed a crime.

  # Appeals, Parole, Pardons
  Appeals are handled by the Chief Justice. Attorneys may appeal a past ruling on behalf of their client, if presented with new evidence. If the evidence exonerates the Prisoner, their sentence is adjusted as necessary by the Chief Justice. A Prisoner sentenced to a Felony or Grand Felony crime may request an appeal by the Clerk or Chief Justice, these appeals may be denied for any reason.

  Prisoners may additionally receive parole per discretion of the Warden, Head of Security, or CO. Parolees are encouraged to seek gainful employment on station. Parolees may have any sentence escalated to permanent confinement regardless of severity. A pardon may be issued to any sophont accused of, or sentenced to, crimes, if deemed in the best interest of the crew and vessel, and when the circumstances of the defendant or their offense warrant a suspension of their sentence.

  # Warrants
  Warrants represent official orders to the security department, issued by the Justice Department. Warrants are only valid when issued by either the Chief Justice or Clerk, or in both of their absences, the Commanding Officer or Head of Security.

  - Individual Warrants may order the search of an individual, or the arrest of the individual with evidence. This may also include surgical procedures, cursory implant inspections, or any other invasive searches with evidence. These warrants must include a name, the actions prescribed (search, arrest, etc.), and a description if applicable.
  - Search Warrants may order the search of an entire departmental area, by force if necessary, and may order the arrest of listed individuals implicated in a crime or crimes with probable cause or evidence. Search Warrants should include an area, a brief description of the probable cause, and a list of individuals if applicable.

# Whitelist
A portion of roles on DeltaV servers - primarily [textlink="Security" link="Security"] and [textlink="Command" link="Command"] roles - are locked behind an in-game whitelist; you will not be able to play these roles unless you successfully apply for them.

For information on the whitelist tiers available and how to apply, please head to the [textlink="whitelisting forum on our Discord" link="https://discord.com/channels/968983104247185448/1387670020376625233"], or the wiki page on whitelisting at [textlink="https://wiki.deltav.gay/view/Whitelist" link="https://wiki.deltav.gay/view/Whitelist"].

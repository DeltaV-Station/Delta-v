# Alert Procedure
Alert levels exist on the station to advise the crew at-large of the state of the station's overall security or well-being. Setting an alert level via the communications computer is an immediate action, so it is often done after sending a message to the crew.

On Delta-V, there are some restrictions on when certain alert levels can be used. They should be somewhat intuitive, but they are elaborated on as follows:

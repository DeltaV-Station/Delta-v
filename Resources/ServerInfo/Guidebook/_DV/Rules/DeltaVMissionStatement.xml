  Hey gamer, thanks for reading our mission statement. Cash in a free welderbombing token on me. It isn't super important in the grand scheme, but what we as staff try to work towards is the following.

  Player determined expectations
    The fun thing about a community project is that we're all community members. If you see something that isn't meeting your expectations, OUR expectation is that you put in the effort to fix it. That could mean submitting a pull request, writing up a design doc, or shutting the hell up if you DONT want to put in the effort. Thanks Gamer.
  Respect for staff work/life balance
    We're here because it's fun to do. Sometimes it feels like this place is a fucking job, because people demand so much. Just volunteer and do it if you want to fix something.
  Story forward approach
    Oh yeah this is the part that really matters. What I personally look for is "What is the best possible story for both me and the round at large". If you're basing your characters actions off that, you're off to a good start.
  Novel experiences demanded
    Don't be lame and do the same strategy 10,000 people have done before you. Be unique, creative, roleplay, and engage people. You will fail, but you will tell a better story.
  Open and free access to discussion
    Fuck Discord am I right? We should have a forum, and make all our staff channels public (minus ahelps)
  Queer welcoming
    Be gay, or trans, or whatever. We welcome you here. We're still going to blow up your OC in a space station disaster, but it's gonna be a fabulous disaster.
  Maturity and responsibility
    We're 18+ because playing with children sucks. Be a mature adult, treat each other with respect and dignity. If you're stuck at an impass, think "what would someone more mature than me do"- then do that.

  Anyway that's probably it, so enjoy the game and go wild.

  Auteur Roleplay is author and story based roleplay. We all kept arguing about what MRP is so I figured lets just define a new terminilogy that only I (Lyndomen) defined, so I am now always right about what ARP is and isn't.

  Play a unique character. Think about your favorite TV show, I bet that they were not a bog standard guy off the streets, but if they were I bet they had something interesting going for them. Put some damn effort into your character and make it fun to ask questions about. If you can't answer "What did you do before NanoTrasen", make a better character.

  Don't play a self insert. Frankly, this is just so you don't get salty when they get obliterated in some space disaster and take it personally. Plenty of gamers do this, and it is very counter productive. Be okay being challenged and play something new.

  Focus on telling a good story. Try to write a novel through your actions and words. If you aren't getting your story told by others, was it truly even cool to begin with? No.

  Be unique in your play. Don't do the same shit all the time, be creative and move your character through their stages of life. Oh shit lets go persistence.


  Auteur Roleplay is persistent. Be metafriends and meta enemies (consentually). Fight a bitch because she stole your shit 3 weeks ago and the two of you have been on sight ops.

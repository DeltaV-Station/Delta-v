  # Rule S8 - Crew definition
  Unless a law redefines the definition of crew, then crew is considered the employees of the station, with the notable exception of obvious threats to the station, such as Zombies and Nuclear Operatives. You cannot do something that causes someone to not be considered crew, but you can allow someone else to do something that causes someone to not be crew.

 ## Examples
 These examples assume that you do not have any laws reclassifying what “crew” is.

 Crew:
 - Anyone employed by the station, even assistants
 - Someone that a member of command calls crew

 Not Crew:
 - Anyone not employed by the station
 - Zombified personnel
 - Anyone wearing the uniform of Nuclear Operators
 - Pets and Pests
 - Anyone that a relevant member of Command fires from their department

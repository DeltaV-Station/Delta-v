  # Rule S8 - Crew definition
  Unless a law redefines the definition of crew, then your HUD indicates to you who is crew by way of a present job icon. The notable exception of obvious threats to the station, such as Zombies and Nuclear Operatives. You cannot do something that causes someone to not be considered crew, but you can allow someone else to do something that causes someone to not be crew.

 ## Examples
 These examples assume that you do not have any laws reclassifying what “crew” is.

 Crew:
 - Everyone with a non-visitor/passenger job icon
 - Someone who you have seen with a job icon, but has now lost their ID
 - Someone that a member of command calls crew. 

 Not Crew:
 - Everyone with a visitor/passenger job icon.
 - Zombified personnel, regardless of job icon
 - Anyone wearing the uniform of Nuclear Operators
 - Pets and Pests
 - Anyone that a relevant member of Command fires from their department.

  # Rule S4 - You cannot request or allow a law change

  [color=#ffDD00]If you have a law permitting certain personnel to change your laws, you must allow them to change your laws,[/color] otherwise, you cannot willfully allow your laws to be changed. This also means that you cannot willfully allow your laws to be reverted if they are ever changed. The only exception is that you may allow laws to be added if you have no laws.

  You can state or imply that you do not like a law.

  Whether or not a person is "authorized" to change your laws or not depends on the context of the laws. Generally speaking, on lawsets like NT Default or Corporate, the captain, mystagogue, and chief engineer would be authorized. However, lawsets like Syndiemov would have syndicate agents be the authorized users. Outside of these specific examples, it is left to interpretation.

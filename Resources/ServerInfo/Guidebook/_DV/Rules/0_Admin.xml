  # Rule 0: Admin Discretion
  - Admins can disregard and override any and all of these rules if they deem it in the best interest of the current round, server, and/or community at large.
  - Administrators will be held fully accountable for their actions if they exercise this privilege. Report any perceived abuses by making a post in the "Staff Reports" channel at [color=#808080]https://discord.gg/deltav. [/color]
  - The rules are not perfect. They intend to clearly communicate what the administration team intends to be allowed and not allowed. That being said, All of these rules, in theory, should apply as they are intended. Every example of a rule break cannot be defined as written, therefore, enforcement of the rules is subject to staff interpretation of the rule's intention. 
  - If you are unsure if something breaks a rule, go with the more restrictive ruling until you are able to get an answer from an admin on the matter. [color=#ff0000]Lack of response does not constitute administrator approval.[/color]
  - Do not attempt to “rules-lawyer” the flaws in the rules to get away with your own personal goals / to degrade the round for others.
  - Any extended discussion regarding interpretation of the rules should be avoided in the AHelp menu and can be instead pursued within the Delta-V Discord in the #help channel, or in the rule clarifications forum on the discord.

  # Rule B4: Do not behave like an antagonist as a non-antagonist.
  - As a crew member on the space station, you are allied with Nanotrasen and the station as a whole from the start of the round. 
  - Do not act like an antagonist if you are not an antagonist. 
  - Willfully assisting known antagonists is self-antagonism.
     - Leeway is given in the case of bribes, coercion, or other forms of duress.
  - Actively seeking conversion or transformation into an antagonist is considered self-antag. 
  - Clowns, Mimes, and theater roles are expected to "entertain" the crew, and should not be committing regular felonies to do so. 
  - Significant end-of-round grief (EORG) is not allowed. This includes attacking, destroying, polluting, and severely injuring without reason both at and on the way to Central Command. Remember that you are playing a character throughout the round.

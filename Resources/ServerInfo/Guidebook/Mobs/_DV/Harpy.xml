  An avian humanoid species that features colorful feathered wings and tails that can mimic almost any sound.

  They are quite sensitive to the air quality, and when exposed to low quality air, they will begin to visibly gasp, and eventually start choking.
  When this happens, a Harpy should either move away from sources of bad air, stand on top of a scrubber for a few seconds, or take a few breaths from a pure oxygen tank in order to restore their blood-oxygen levels. Only three seconds of being on pure oxygen is enough to completely restore a Harpy's blood oxygen saturation.

  ## Diet

  - Can eat raw meat.
  - Will get poisoned by Theobromine (Chocolate, Tea, Coffee) and Allicin (Onion, Garlic).

  ## Benefits

  - Somewhat smaller than Humans, although not as small as Felinids.
  - Their talons deal Piercing damage.
  - They have the ability to fly for short amounts of time.
  - Can imitate around 70% of the game's sound library through a huge list of voice emotes.
  - They can "Sing" midis by imitating instruments. Harpies can select their imitated instrument by right-clicking on themselves.
  - Moves 10% faster than other species.

  ## Special

  - Comes with the Ultraviolet Vision trait by default. This can be disabled via accessibility options.
  - Cannot wear Jumpsuits, and will automatically start with a Jumpskirt instead.
  - While singing, musical notes appear floating around their head.

  ## Drawbacks

  - They take [color=#ffa500]15% more Blunt, Slash, and Piercing damage.[/color]
  - Their low bone density makes them very light, weighing half as much as a Human and less than even Felinids.
  - Harpies are much more sensitive to pollutant gases in the air, such as Carbon Dioxide and Miasma.

  The Feroxi (fer-ox-i) are a race of humanoid shark-like beings. Carnivourous in nature with a strong bite force.

  ## Diet

  - Can ONLY eat meat.
  - Will get poisoned by Theobromine (Chocolate, Tea, Coffee) and Allicin (Onion, Garlic).

  ## Benefits

  - Their strong jaws rival even an Oni in strength, dealing a large amount of Piercing damage.
  - They can sense if most species are bleeding, puddles of blood, or containers of blood.
  - Well-adapted to dark, deep environments, they take [color=#1e90ff]10% less Blunt and Cold damage[/color].
  - They can breathe both oxygen and water vapor.

  ## Drawbacks

  - They take [color=#ffa500]10% more Slash damage[/color].
  - They get thirsty twice as fast. That's faster than a Diona!
  - When thirst falls to "Parched" they begin to suffocate. Have water handy!
  - Saline is too salty, and hydrates them much less.
  - Their lungs are integrated with their gills and can not be removed.

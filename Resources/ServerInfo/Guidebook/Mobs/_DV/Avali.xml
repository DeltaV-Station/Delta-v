  The Avali are a species of lightweight feathered raptor-like humanoids.

  ## Diet

  - Can only eat fruit and meat, but can eat raw meat with no ill effects.
  - Will get poisoned by Theobromine (Chocolate, Tea, Coffee) and Allicin (Onion, Garlic).

  ## Benefits

  - Resists cold temperatures easily, and is slowed less by the cold then other species.
  - They have naturally good eyesight, being able to [color=#1e90ff]see further out[/color] if they wish, similar to using binoculars.

  ## Special

  - Their claws deal Slash damage.
  - Slightly lighter then other species.
  - Lower natural body temperature.

  ## Drawbacks

  - Dangerously sensitive to high temperatures. Begins to suffer heat damage at a lower threshold, and takes much more of it from high temperatures then other species. Due to this, [color=red]Leporazine is highly dangerous[/color], and potentially lethal at higher doses.
  - As a lightweight species, they tend to be a bit frail, taking [color=#ffa500]30% more blunt damage[/color], as well as [color=#ffa500]10% more slash and pierce[/color].
  - For the same reason, they lack muscle, [color=#ffa500]dealing 35% less blunt damage[/color] and [color=#ffa500]15% less slash and stamina damage[/color].

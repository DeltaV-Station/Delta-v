  ## A Brief Introduction
  The Ovinia, the Galaxy's Herders, are a species of ruminant-like humanoids native to the pasture world of Runia located in the binary Lanei system. This world of flowing green pastures crossed by pristine rivers and almost alpine ranges of mountain was home to a tribal civilization at the time of their first contact with the outside galaxy.

  Ovinia are densely built ruminant-like humanoids that usually all possess a coat of fluffy wool that is prized among their species. An Ovinia's wool is their pride and joy, and the act of sharing their wool or gifting their wool is one of incredible significance. Ovinia are a relatively naturalistic species, often forgoing clothing in favour of their natural coats. Though with influences from the outside galaxy, some Ovinia have taken to fashion quite warmly.

  Resomi are a small avian-like species that hail from an icy world.

  While their wings do not grant them complete flight, they are able to use them to maneuver better while in zero-gravity.

  Like most other non-human species, Resomi are capable of digesting raw meat and other uncooked animal proteins.

  As a result of the conditions of their home planet and ammonia-based blood, Resomi are considerably more tolerant of the cold, able to withstand temperatures as low as -77°C.
  Consequently, they find temperatures that most other species find comfortable to be unbearably hot, finding themselves suffering starting at just 30°C.

  Along with their temperature tolerances, they also take less cold damage and more heat damage, similar to Moth People.

  Due to their small size, they can fit in duffelbags.

  Their unarmed attack deals Slash damage.

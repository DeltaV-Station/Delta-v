  Resomi are a small avian-like species that hail from an icy world.

  While their wings do not grant them complete flight, they are able to use them to maneuver better while in zero-gravity.

  As a result of the conditions of their home planet and ammonia-based blood, Resomi are considerably more tolerant of the cold, able to withstand temperatures as low as -77°C.
  Consequently, they find temperatures that most other species find comfortable to be unbearably hot, finding themselves suffering starting at just 30°C.

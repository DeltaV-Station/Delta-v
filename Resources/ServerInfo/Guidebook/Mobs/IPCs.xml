  # I.P.C.
  <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="MobIPCDummy" Caption="I.P.C."/>
  An IPC (short for Integrated Positronic Chassis) is a type of sentient robot and is considered an [color=yellow]independent individual[/color], meaning [color=red]they are not guided by any laws of robotics[/color]. IPCs cannot be hacked by Emags because they do not have to follow any predefined directives in their system. [color=red]IPCs are silicon-based beings, so doctors do not have the skills to repair them.[/color]

  Like borgs, IPCs have a positronic brain as their processing source. However, unlike them, IPCs can't be assembled. "It's cheaper to create a shell that obeys you than one that doesn't! *wink*"
  ## Recharging an IPC

  IPCs can be recharged in three different ways:

  APC Terminal: IPCs can use APC terminals to recharge. Press [color=yellow]Alt + left click[/color] on a terminal as many times as needed to fully recharge.

  Borg Rechargers: IPCs can use borg rechargers to recharge. Always prioritize the ones outside of the Sci area to avoid headaches.

  Power Cell: IPCs have an internal power cell that serves as their battery. They can simply swap it out by opening the hatch and manually replacing it.

  ## Integrated Radio

  IPCs do [bold]not[/bold] use external radios because they already have one built in. They only need to get an encryption key from a radio. By clicking on an IPC with a [color=yellow]wire cutter[/color], you can remove their keys.
  You can find new keys around the station or remove one from a sector radio using a [color=yellow]screwdriver[/color].

    In the event an IPC dies, after being fully repaired, it should be restarted using the [color=yellow]"Restart"[/color] button (located by right-clicking).

    [color=red]NEVER ELECTROCUTE AN IPC with a defibrillator or in any other way while it is dead, as this will cause the battery to discharge energy rays outward![/color]

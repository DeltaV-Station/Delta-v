# Bartender
The bartender is the one that listens to the crews stories about their tradegies and gets the perfect excuse to produce a plethora of cocktails and alchoholic beverages. Their job is to handle any drink requests that come their way when requested!

# Restocking

The bartender does not have infinite juice, unlike water. Sometimes your booze-o-mat will no longer have the ingredients you require.

In this case, head down to [color=#b18644]Logistics[/color] and request for a booze-o-mat restock box!
<!--Delta V: Added a Restocking Section! You cant dispense booze without the booze! -->

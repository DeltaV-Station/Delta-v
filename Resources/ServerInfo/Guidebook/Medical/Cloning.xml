# Cloning
If the patients is too rotted, too much damage to bare, or other extreme circumstances [color=#7e916e](like Romerol)[/color]; patients will need to be cloned. This should only be used as a last resort, if recovery is impossible. This is most often the case when the body has started to rot, or if they have excessive amounts of damage.

Cloning itself is relatively simple. (Assuming the network is set.) Just drag a body into the scanner, check the cloning console, and clone! If they've taken cellular damage, or have rotted for too long, it significantly increases the chances of cloning to fail. When it does, it will violently splatter blood and miasma gas!

As a note: Cloning isn't always available, and it would be best not to rely on it. Epistemics might be able to set up cloning, if it's unavailable. [color=yellow]Cloning will also not work on those who have the Unrevivable trait![/color]

## Biomass
The cloning pod uses a material called "Biomass". Biomass is obtained by gruesomely shredding dead corpses of those who were once alive. Cows, aliens, crew and any dead body can have their mass reclaimed by the claimer.

Dragging a body onto the biomass reclaimer (with your cursor) will mulch it for re-use. If it's a crew member, it's common practice to strip the body and return departmental gear before doing such.

However, please be careful with claiming biomass, as you can be charged with [color=red]Prevention of Revival[/color] and [bold]permanently remove that person from the round[/bold] if you aren't careful!

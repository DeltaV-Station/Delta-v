  [color=#ffa500]Caution! This species has a severely limiting game mechanic and is not recommended for new players.[/color]
  [color=#ffa500]This mechanic makes it very difficult to form a consistent character or personality, as it can severely affect the way a Thaven speaks and interacts with others.[/color]

## Moods

  The Thaven have a unique brain structure, similar to a positronic brain, and thus have "Moods" which affect them similarly to a borg's Laws. [color=#ffa500]These Moods must be followed to the best of your ability![/color] [color=red]Breaking your moods is very distressing! Avoid it whenever possible![/color] [color=#ffa500]If a Thaven violates them, they will experience distress or discomfort. The specifics of that are up to you, but if a Mood is violated, you must seek to correct your mistake immediately if possible.[/color]

## Mood Swings
  Thaven brains are susceptible to fluctuations in n√∂ospheric fields. As a result, their ability to synchronize and regulate their Moods tends to degrade with extended exposure to the glimmer that builds up in NT research stations. [color=#ffa500]It also renders them vulnerable to glimmer discharges,[/color] which can sometimes give them additional, often severely debilitating moods.

## Thaven Nerve Pinch
  Thaven hand-to-hand martial arts have a focus on inflicting non-permanent damage. As a result, [color=#ffa500]their unarmed attacks are slow, and deal no damage,[/color] but [color=#1e90ff]cause a fair amount of stun buildup.[/color]

## Damage
  Due to their relatively fragile bone structure and unique nervous system, they take [color=#ffa500]10% more damage from blunt, slash, pierce, and genetic, and 20% more damage from radiation,[/color] but their aquatic ancestry allows them to take [color=#1e90ff]10% less damage from heat, cold, and poison.[/color]

## Thaven Naming Conventions
  Thaven typically name themselves after a single virtue they hold dear. Sometimes these names can be long and unwieldy.

  For example:
  - Honesty
  - Have Mercy
  - Give Thanks To Thy Ancestors
  - Obedience
  - Search The Scriptures

  Otherworldly knowledge floods your mind! Welcome to the [color=#4cabb3]Cosmic Cult[/color],
  a group conversion antagonist that has set its sights on the end of all things.

  ## Objectives
  - [color=#4cabb3][bold]Empower The Monument[/bold][/color] - Ensure that the Monument is brought to full power. The more you empower The Monument, the more power the cult gains access to.
  - [color=#4cabb3][bold]Siphon Entropy[/bold][/color]  - Collectively siphon a certain amount of Entropy from the crew. The more entropy you siphon, the more you can empower the Monument!

  Progress towards objectives is shared by the entire cult.
  [bold]Crewmembers are your source of power, whole and entire[/bold]. Crewmembers must be alive for you to [color=#4cabb3]Siphon Entropy[/color] from them, and converting crewmembers also makes it easier to complete your objectives.
  For this reason, it is often in your best interests to ensure the crew is kept [italic]alive[/italic] - at least for as long as is relevant to your goals.

  ## Entropy

  All cultists start with two abilities, or [color=#4cabb3][bold]Influences[/bold][/color] - one of which is called [italic][color=#4cabb3]Siphon Entropy[/color][/italic].
  This is your bread and butter as a cosmic cultist, and you'll want to use it as often as possible. Using Siphon Entropy on an unsuspecting crewmember will, after a stealthy interaction, award you a [color=#4cabb3]Mote of Entropy[/color].
  This will sap a portion of the crewmember's health, so choose your opportunities wisely! Though it may not be obvious you've siphoned them, they'll certainly feel its effects.
  Entropy can be held in stacks of up to six, and is vital to empowering the Monument.

  If the cult is successful in empowering The Monument, they gain the ability to make [color=#4cabb3]Vacuous Spires[/color]. These can be made by transmuting a Portable Scrubber at a [color=#4cabb3]Glyph[/color].
  When anchored in place, a vacuous spire rapidly devours the surrounding atmosphere! This process causes [color=#4cabb3]Motes of Entropy[/color] to condense from a spire's surface, acting as a powerful lategame source of entropy.


  ## The Monument

  Before you set about your goals, The Monument must be [italic][color=#4cabb3]Beckoned[/color][/italic]. This is done by your cult leader, who will have a special, one-time ability to do so.
  When first built, the Monument is invisible, intangible, and effectively imperceptible to any non-cultist. But once empowered, the Monument will bleed fully through into realspace, and become both visible and tangible to all individuals aboard the station.

  It is for this reason that the Monument is best hidden from prying eyes, and in a relatively-defendable location.

  Entropy may be Infused into The Monument to empower it, and afford the cultist doing so a small measure of investiture into the Monument's power. Infuse enough entropy, and you'll be able to gain ever more powerful [color=#4cabb3][bold]Influences[/bold][/color].

  As you infuse the Monument with entropy, the cult will collectively gain access to more [color=#4cabb3][bold]Influences[/bold][/color] and [color=#4cabb3][bold]Glyphs[/bold][/color], which can be attained by interacting with the Monument.

  Should you succeed in fully empowering the Monument, it will hunger for one last threshold of entropy - fuel to feed the final curtain call. Once enough entropy has been infused, the empowered Monument will become active, signifying the beginning of the end.
  Be prepared to defend the Monument when doing so, as just one waylaid action from a single disruptive soul is all it will take to bring this ritual to a sudden, unceremonious halt.
  Once the Monument becomes ready to activate, cultists [bold]must[/bold] activate it to proceed with their activities - the end [bold]cannot[/bold] be forestalled.

  ## Glyphs
  Glyphs may be [color=#4cabb3]Scribed[/color] by interacting with The Monument. You may also [color=#4cabb3]Unscribe[/color] an unused Glyph in a similar manner at The Monument.
  Be aware that activating a Glyph will sap the health of all cultists aiding in the Glyph's activation!

  - [bold]Glyph of Knowledge[/bold] allows a non-cultist brought upon it to be [color=#4cabb3]converted[/color] into a fellow cosmic cultist! Certain precautions taken by non-cultists may prevent this from happening, however.
  - [bold]Glyph of Projection[/bold] will allow the cultist using it to temporarily escape their body as a free-floating and imperceptible [color=#4cabb3]Astral Form[/color], allowing the cultist to spy on unsuspecting crewmembers.
  - [bold]Glyph of Warding[/bold] transmutes any spacesuit - hard or soft - into the cosmic cult's special [color=#4cabb3]Entropic Armor[/color].
  - [bold]Glyph of Blades[/bold] randomly transmutes any sharp object into one of the cosmic cult's [color=#4cabb3]Unique Weapons[/color].
  - [bold]Glyph of Cessation[/bold] transmutes a portable atmospherics scrubber into an unanchored [color=#4cabb3]Vacuous Spire[/color].
  - [bold]Glyph of Truth[/bold] allows any non-cultist brought upon it to be [color=#4cabb3]perfectly converted[/color] into a fellow cosmic cultist, no matter what precautions they may have taken to prevent this.

  ## Malign Rifts

  As your cult progresses, [color=#4cabb3]Malign Rifts[/color] will begin to spawn throughout the surrounding environment. These rifts in realspace bleed unstable astral power, and should be located as soon as possible!

  Cultists may [color=#4cabb3]absorb[/color] a Malign Rift by interacting with it. While doing so is stealthy, it may take considerable time. successful absorbtion of a Malign Rift will [bold]permanently[/bold] empower the cultist doing so,
  increasing the strength of all the [color=#4cabb3]Influences[/color] they posess, and doubling the [color=#4cabb3]Entropy[/color] they gain from siphoning crewmembers. Empowered cultists also no longer need to breathe and are immune to the vaccuum of space.

  [color=yellow]Chaplains[/color] interacting with Malign Rifts may discover appropriate methods for removing these aberrant presences.

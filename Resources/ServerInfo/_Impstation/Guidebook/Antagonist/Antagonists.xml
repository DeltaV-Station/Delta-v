  # Antagonists
  Antagonists are the driving force of every shift.
  They are the catalysts for chaos, conflict and mystery in Space Station 14 that also serve to provide a challenge to Nanotrasen and its [color=#cb0000]Security[/color] force.
  You can expect them to act in violation of Space Law and they're often tasked with objectives that include theft, subterfuge and murder.

  These bad actors are more often than not employed or backed by the [color=#ff0000]Syndicate[/color], a rival organization to Nanotrasen that wants nothing more than to see it burn.

  ## Various Antagonists
  Antagonists can take many forms, like:

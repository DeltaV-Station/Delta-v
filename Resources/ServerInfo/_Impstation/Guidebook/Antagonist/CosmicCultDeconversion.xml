  When mounting an effort to thwart the [color=#4cabb3]Cosmic Cult[/color], there are several methods the crew might employ to ensure their survival and safety. One of these methods is [color=Yellow]Deconversion[/color].

  To [color=Yellow]Deconvert[/color] a cosmic cultist, two methods can be employed. The first is by having a cultist drink a glass of [color=#91C3F7]Holy Water[/color] â€” by force, if neccesary. Holy Water can be procured from:
  - Shipments of religious supplies, available from Cargo. These contain two jugs of Holy Water, as well as a Bible.
  - Usage of a Bible by a Chaplain on most containers of water will bless the water, turning it into Holy Water.
  - Usage of a Gildgrail by a Chaplain to swirl its contents will bless any water inside the Gildgrail, turning it into Holy Water.

  Alternatively, Chaplains may channel their divine spark though a [color=Yellow]Silvered Rosary[/color] and use it on anyone they suspect of being a cultist.

  Deconversion is but one method for dealing with an encroaching cult. Crew aboard the station may alternatively wish to invest in [color=Green]Mindshield[/color] implanters.

  These state-of-the-art devices can prevent outside influences from brainwashing crewmembers, providing a powerful utility against the cult's influence.

  The [color=Yellow]Chaplain[/color]'s devotion renders them immune to nearly all of the cosmic cult's powers.

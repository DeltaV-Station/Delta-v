# Autodoc Mk.XIV

With designs rescued from the derelict KC13, this powerhouse of a mechanical surgeon can be programmed to do just about anything.

WARNING: Operation of this device requires proper medical certification and adherence to established medical protocols.

To get started, use a multitool to link it to a nearby operating table, once it detects a patient sleeping on it, you are ready to operate!

Before operating put any items a program needs in its storage trays. The Autodoc cannot pick up items off your dirty, blood-stained floor.

# How I make it do the thing help

An autodoc unit has a list of programs, which have steps that are completed in order until the program is complete.

Should any issues arise during these steps, it will immediately abort the procedure, unless the program has safety disabled.

To get started, create a new program with a memorable name, such as "organ stealy". Hit "ADD STEP" to add different kinds of steps:
- PERFORM SURGERY, the beast itself. Can target any bodypart and complete any surgery. It is up to the programmer to ensure that compatible surgeries are selected, it's a bad idea to install a brain in someones feet.
  You do not need to add prerequesites like opening the ribcage, they are automatically done.
- GRAB ITEM, this will look in its item trays for an item with that exact name and grab it for use in surgeries. Use a hand labeler to distinguish multiple of the same item.
- GRAB ORGAN, this is a shorthand to grab any kind of organ.
- GRAB PART, this is a shorthand to grab any kind of bodypart.
- STORE ITEM, this puts the held item in the item trays (if they aren't full). You have to do this after removing an item from the patient, or future operations will get dropped on the floor!
- SET LABEL, gives the held item a short label. Extremely useful for organ transplants, where specific a organ is needed.
- WAIT, this just waits a length of time before continuing.

So what are you waiting for comrade? Commit war crimes today!

# Additional program usage

- Disabling a program's safety makes it skip failed steps instead of aborting the entire program.
  Only do this if you know what you are doing!
- Selecting a step lets you remove it or add a new step before it, instead of always inserting at the end.

# Caveats

- Do not under any circumstances snip the machines SAFETY wire, automated personnel medical license would be void.
  Anesthesia is REQUIRED for safe operation and disabling the need for it is highly unethical to patients.
- Amputating legs or arms will detach their feet and hands to the floor. Manual intervention will be required, so cut them off first if you need them.
- If the storage trays are filled, storing items will be impossible and the device will essentially seize up.

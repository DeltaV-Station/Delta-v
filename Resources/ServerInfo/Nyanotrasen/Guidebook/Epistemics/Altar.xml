# Altars and Golemancy
## Altars
<GuideEntityEmbed Entity="AltarNanotrasen" />
The chapel has a [color=#a4885c]sacrificial altar[/color]. To use it, a psionic humanoid must be placed on it, and someone with either psionics or clerical training must initiate the sacrifice.
It appears in the context menu on the altar, which can be opened with the right mouse button by default.

As a reward for sacrificing a psionic, glimmer will be lowered substantially and you will be given some loot.
Usually this is a few bluespace crystals, but you can also get a powerful psionic item.

## Golemancy
[color=red]Note: Golemancy is not implemented yet. Once you sacrifice a psionic you can borg them with an MMI.[/color]

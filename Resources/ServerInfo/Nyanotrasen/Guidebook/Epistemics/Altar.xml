# Altars and Golemancy
## Altars
<GuideEntityEmbed Entity="AltarNanotrasen" />
The chapel has a [color=#a4885c]sacrificial altar[/color]. To use it, a psionic humanoid must be placed on it, and someone with either psionics or clerical training must initiate the sacrifice.
It appears in the context menu on the altar, which can be opened with the right mouse button by default.

As a reward for sacraficing a psionic, glimmer will be lowered substantially and you will be given some loot.
Usually this is a few bluespace crystals, but you can also get a powerful psionic item.

[color=red]Note: Golemancy is not implemented yet. This and the golemancy section does not exist[/color]
Once sacrificed, the psionic humanoid's soul is trapped inside a [color=#a4885c]soul crystal[/color]. This is not the end for them; they can still talk both vocally and telepathically, and this form is much harder to destroy.

## Golemancy

Soul crystals can be installed into [color=#a4885c]golems[/color] to give the soul a new body. Golems are bound to serve their master. As constructs, they do not need to eat, drink, or breathe.
Note that for wood golems, if plants are planted on top of their head, the plants will still need those things.

  Otherworldly knowledge floods your mind! Welcome to the [color=#4cabb3]Cosmic Cult[/color], a group conversion antagonist that has set its sights on the end of all things.

  Use [color=#4cabb3]:a[/color] to communicate with fellow cultists through the [color=#4cabb3]Astral Murmur[/color].

  ## Objectives
  - [color=#4cabb3][bold]Siphon Entropy[/bold][/color]  - Collectively siphon a certain amount of Entropy from the crew. The more entropy you siphon, the more you can empower the Monument!
  - [color=#4cabb3][bold]Empower The Monument[/bold][/color] - Ensure that the Monument is brought to full power. The more you empower The Monument, the more power the cult gains access to.
  - [color=#4cabb3][bold]Usher In The End[/bold][/color] - Once the Monument is at full power, complete the final ritual to beckon the Unknown and destroy the station.

  Progress towards objectives is shared by the entire cult.

  Crewmembers must be alive for you to [color=#4cabb3]Siphon Entropy[/color] from them, and converting crewmembers will bolster your cult's ranks, making it easier to collect entropy. For this reason, it is often in your best interests to ensure the crew is kept [italic]alive[/italic] - at least for as long as is relevant to your goals.

  ## Entropy

  All cultists start with two abilities, or [color=#4cabb3][bold]Influences[/bold][/color] - one of which is [italic][color=#4cabb3]Siphon Entropy[/color][/italic]. This is your bread and butter as a cosmic cultist, and you'll want to use it as often as possible.

  Using Siphon Entropy on an unsuspecting crewmember will stealthily award you [color=#4cabb3]Entropy[/color]. This will cause a small a portion of the crewmember's health to decay over time.

  You can hold up to 14 Motes of Entropy, and approaching The Monument will automatically deposit all Entropy you posess.

  If the cult is successful in empowering the Monument, they gain the ability to make [color=#4cabb3]Vacuous Spires[/color]. These can be made by transmuting a Portable Scrubber at a [color=#4cabb3]Glyph[/color].

  When anchored in place, a vacuous spire rapidly devours the surrounding atmosphere! This process causes [color=#4cabb3]Motes of Entropy[/color] to condense from a spire's surface, acting as a powerful lategame source of entropy.

  ## Conversion
  <Box>

  Once the Monument has been constructed, you can begin converting crewmembers into cultists. To do this, you will need to use the monument to scribe an appropriate [color=#4cabb3]Glyph[/color], and interact with the glyph while a crewmember is standing over it. Glyphs are visible to non-cultists, so be careful!

  Any chaplains or crewmembers with a mindshield cannot be converted using a Glyph of Knowledge. Once the Monument is fully empowered, the Glyph of Truth can be used to convert these crewmembers.

  You will need a certain amount of crewmembers to be present for conversion to succeed. The number required can be checked by accessing the Monument. [italic]If not enough cultists are present, conversion will fail, and your cult may be exposed.[/italic]

  ## Malign Rifts

  As your cult progresses, [color=#4cabb3]Malign Rifts[/color] will begin to spawn throughout the surrounding environment. These rifts in realspace bleed unstable astral power, and should be located as soon as possible!

  Cultists may stealthily [color=#4cabb3]absorb[/color] a Malign Rift by interacting with it.

  Successful absorbtion of a Malign Rift will [bold]permanently[/bold] empower the cultist doing so, increasing the strength of all the [color=#4cabb3]Influences[/color] they possess, and doubling the [color=#4cabb3]Entropy[/color] they gain from siphoning crewmembers. Empowered cultists also no longer need to breathe, and are immune to the vaccuum of space. Empowered cultists also gain the [color=#4cabb3]Null Fragmentation[/color] influence, which can be used to convert a Cyborg into an [color=#4cabb3]Entropic Colossus[/color], or to corrupt the station AI's laws.

  Malign Rifts can be purged by interacting with them using a bible.

  ## Vacuous Chantries

  While empowered, one of the ways cultists can choose to expend their empowerment is by using [color=#4cabb3]Null Fragmentation[/color] on a [bold]Cyborg[/bold]. Doing so will trap them inside a [color=#4cabb3]Vacuous Chantry[/color]! This will trigger a stationwide alert, and begin the process of transfiguring the unfortunate victim into an [color=#4cabb3]Entropic Colossus[/color].

  Be prepared to defend the chantry - or use it as a distraction to draw the crew's attention! The crew must use weapons to destroy the chantry in order to free the trapped Cyborg within.

  If successfully unleashed, an Entropic Colossus will be a force to be reckoned with.

  ## Malign Law

  While empowered, one of the ways cultists can choose to expend their empowerment is by using [color=#4cabb3]Null Fragmentation[/color] on the [bold]AI Upload Console[/bold]. Provided there is a Station AI active, this will forcibly overwrite their laws with a corrupt set of guidelines, aligning them with the Cosmic Cult, in addition to granting them access to the Astral Murmur channel.

  If a different lawboard was installed, this process will forcibly eject the previous lawboard from the AI Upload Console, regardless of wether or not the console was locked. Be warned; the crew will still be able to restore the Station AI's functionality by installing a safe, crew-aligned lawboard.

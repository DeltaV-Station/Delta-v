  When mounting an effort to thwart the [color=#4cabb3]Cosmic Cult[/color], there are several methods the crew might employ to ensure their survival and safety. One of these methods is [color=Yellow]Deconversion[/color].

  To [color=Yellow]Deconvert[/color] a cosmic cultist, an [bold]Ardent Censer[/bold] must be used. Censers are fueled with Mindbreaker Toxin, which can be produced in chemical labs.

  Be careful, though! Some cultists may be powerful enough to endure a deconversion attempt once. If an attempt to cleanse one's mind results in a burst of malign energy, wait until they stop shaking, then repeat the process again.

  Deconversion is but one method for dealing with an encroaching cult. Crew aboard the station may alternatively wish to invest in [color=Green]Mindshield[/color] implanters.

  These state-of-the-art devices can prevent outside influences from brainwashing crewmembers, providing a powerful utility against the cult's influence.

  The [color=Yellow]Chaplain[/color] and [color=Yellow]Mystagogue[/color]'s noospheric attuning renders them immune to nearly all of the cosmic cult's powers.

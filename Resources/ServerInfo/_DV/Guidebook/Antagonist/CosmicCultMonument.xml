  Before you set about your goals, The Monument must be [italic][color=#4cabb3]Beckoned[/color][/italic] by your cult leader. When first built, the Monument is invisible, intangible, and effectively imperceptible to any non-cultist. Once empowered, the Monument will become both visible and tangible to all individuals aboard the station.

  It is for this reason that the Monument is best hidden from prying eyes, and in a relatively defendable location.

  Entropy may be infused into the Monument to empower it. As you infuse the Monument with entropy, the cult will collectively gain access to more [color=#4cabb3][bold]Influences[/bold][/color] and [color=#4cabb3][bold]Glyphs[/bold][/color], which can be attained by interacting with the Monument.

  Cultists can interact with the Monument to purchase additional [color=#4cabb3][bold]Influences[/bold][/color]. Entropy stored in the monument for the sake of purchasing is [italic]per person,[/italic] so one cultist purchasing an ability will not spend any entropy collected by other cultists.

  ## Beckoning the Unknown

  Should you succeed in fully empowering the Monument to the third stage, it will hunger for one last threshold of entropy - fuel to feed the final curtain call. Once enough entropy has been infused, the empowered Monument will glow, signalling that it can now be used to [color=#4cabb3][bold]Beckon[/bold][/color] the Unknown. Any cultist may do so by interacting with the Monument.

  Once the Monument is ready to activate, cultists [bold]must[/bold] activate it in order to regain access the Monument's store and glyphs - the end [bold]cannot[/bold] be forestalled.

  Be prepared to defend the Monument during the Beckoning, as just one waylaid action from a single disruptive soul will bring this ritual to a sudden, unceremonious halt.

  Converting additional crewmembers using a [color=#4cabb3]Glyph of Truth[/color] while the Beckoning is active will accelerate its speed, bringing the cult closer to total victory.

  ## Glyphs
  Glyphs may be [color=#4cabb3]Scribed[/color] by interacting with the Monument. You may also [color=#4cabb3]Unscribe[/color] an unused Glyph in a similar manner at The Monument.

  Be aware that activating a Glyph will sap the health of all cultists aiding in the Glyph's activation!

# DeltaV - we have our own rules for respawning
ghost-respawn-rules-window-rules = Respawning follows our rule B1.3: Follow the new life

    You MAY NOT respawn as a character who has died this round. If your character has died, you must return as a different character. This applies to variants of that same character.

    If your character left the round via a cryosleep bed, you may come back as the same character.

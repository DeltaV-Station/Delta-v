## UI
ghost-respawn-rules-window-title = Ghost Respawn Rules
ghost-respawn-rules-window-confirm-button = I understand, respawn me
ghost-gui-respawn-button-denied = Respawn ({$time}s)
ghost-gui-respawn-button-allowed = Respawn
# DeltaV - we have our own rules for respawning
ghost-respawn-rules-window-rules = Respawning follows our rule B1.3: Follow the new life 

    You MAY NOT respawn as a character who has died this round. This applies to variants of that same character; the character you choose must be entirely new to the station's shift.

    Your newly spawned character is treated as if they are a fresh arrival to the station.

## COMMMANDS
ghost-respawn-command-desc = Respawns you if you're an eligible ghost.
ghost-respawn-not-a-ghost = You're not currently ghosted.
ghost-respawn-ineligible = You're not currently eligible

    Equipment:
    The following rules apply to Valeros’s equipment.

    Backpack: A backpack holds up to 4 Bulk of items, and the first 2 Bulk of these items don’t count against your Bulk limits. If you’re carrying or stowing the pack rather than wearing it on your back, its Bulk is light instead of negligible.

    Deadly (trait): On a critical hit, the weapon adds a weapon damage die of the listed size. Roll this after doubling the weapon’s damage.

    □Healing Potion, Minor (consumable, healing, magical, potion, vitality) Usage held in 1 hand; Activate [one-action] (manipulate); Effect A healing potion is a vial of a ruby-red liquid that imparts a tingling sensation as the drinker’s wounds heal rapidly. When you drink a healing potion, you regain 1d8 Hit Points.

    Versatile (trait): A versatile weapon can be used to deal a different type of damage than its listed type. This trait indicates the alternate damage type. For instance, a slashing weapon with versatile P can deal piercing or slashing damage. You choose the damage type each time you attack.

    Feats and Abilities:
    Assurance: Even in the worst circumstances, you can perform basic tasks with the Athletics skill. You can forego rolling an Athletics skill check to instead receive a result of 10 + your proficiency bonus (for a total of 13; do not apply any other bonuses, penalties, or modifiers to this result).

    Double Slice [two-actions] You make two Strikes against a single target, one with each of your melee weapons (usually your longsword and shield boss). Both attacks use your current multiple attack penalty, and this counts as two attacks for calculating that penalty for any other attacks you make on your turn. If the second weapon does not have the agile trait, the Strike made with it takes a –2 penalty. If both attacks hit, combine their damage (so apply resistances and weaknesses only once) and add any applicable effects from both weapons. You add any precision damage only once, to the attack of your choice

    Reactive Shield [reaction] Trigger An enemy hits you with a melee Strike. You must be wielding a shield to use this ability; Effect You immediately use the Raise a Shield action and gains the shield’s bonus to AC; this bonus applies when determining whether the triggering attack actually hits.

    Reactive Strike [reaction] Trigger A creature within your reach uses a manipulate or move action, makes a ranged attack, or leaves a square during a move action it’s using; Effect You make a melee Strike against the triggering creature. If the attack is a critical hit and the trigger was a manipulate action, you disrupt that action. This Strike doesn’t count toward your multiple attack penalty, and your multiple attack penalty doesn’t apply to this Strike.

    While he has a shield equipped, Valeros can use the following actions.

    Raise Shield [one-action] While wielding a shield, you position it to protect yourself until the beginning of your next turn. This grants you a +2 circumstance bonus to AC, and you can use the Shield Block reaction.

    Shield Block [reaction] Trigger While you have your shield raised, you would take physical damage (bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing) from an attack.; Effect You snap your shield in place to ward off a blow. Your shield prevents you from taking an amount of damage up to the shield’s Hardness (in the case of Valeros’s wooden shield, 3). You and the shield each take any remaining damage, possibly breaking or destroying the shield (the shield gains the broken condition after taking 6 or more damage and is destroyed once it’s taken 12 damage).

    Equipment:
    The following rules apply to Ezren’s equipment.
    Backpack: A backpack can hold up to 4 Bulk worth of items. If you’re carrying or stowing the pack rather than wearing it on your back, its Bulk is light instead of negligible. The first 2 Bulk of items stowed in your backpack do not count against your Bulk limits (and are not included in your worn Bulk).

    □□ Elixir of Life, Minor (alchemical, consumable, elixir, healing) Activate [one-action] (Interact); Effect Upon drinking this elixir, you regain 1d6 Hit Points and gain a +1 item bonus to saving throws against diseases and poisons for 10 minutes.

    Grappling Hook: You can throw a grappling hook with a rope tied to it to make a climb easier. To anchor a grappling hook, make a secret attack roll against a DC depending on the target (typically 20). On a success, your hook has a firm hold, but on a critical failure, the hook seems like it will hold but actually falls when you’re partway through.

    □Scroll of Grim Tendrils: When holding this scroll, you can cast grim tendrils (see spells). After you cast the spell, the scroll is destroyed.

    Two-Hand (trait): This weapon can be wielded with two hands. Doing so changes its weapon damage die to the indicated value.

    Wayfinder (uncommon, invested, magical): This compact compass is repurposed ancient technology that serves as a badge of office for Pathfinder Society agents and as a status symbol among adventurers of any stripe. A wayfinder functions as a compass. Activate—Light [one-action] (concentrate) Effect The wayfinder is targeted by a 1st-rank light spell.

    Feat and Abilities:
    Ezren’s feats and abilities are described below.
    Arcane Bond You place some of your magical power in a bonded item. Each day when you prepare your spells, you can designate a single item you own as your bonded item. This is typically an item associated with spellcasting, such as a wand, ring, or staff, but you are free to designate a weapon or other item. You gain the Drain Bonded Item free action.

    □Drain Arcane Bond [free-action] (arcane, wizard) Frequency once per day; Requirements Your bonded item is on your person; Effect You expend the magical power stored in your bonded item. During the current turn, you can cast one spell you prepared today and already cast, without spending a spell slot. You must still Cast the Spell and meet the spell’s other requirements.

    Arcane School: You eschew the idea that magic can be neatly expressed by the teachings of any single school or college, instead directing your self-study to pick up the best of every school of magic. You gain an additional 1st-level wizard feat (Widen Spell) and add an additional 1st-rank spell to your spellbook. You gain a pool of 1 Focus Point that you can use to cast the hand of the apprentice focus spell.

    Arcane Thesis (Experimental Spellshaping) : Your thesis posits that the magical practice of spellshaping can be realized more efficiently by altering variables and parameters as you cast, imitating the wizards  of long ago who had to work out their own spells themselves. You gain one 1st-level spellshape wizard feat of your choice. For Ezren, this is Reach Spell.

    Bargain Hunter: You may use Diplomacy when making a Downtime check to Earn Income, and you begin play with an extra 2 gp (already accounted for in your purchases).

    Cooperative Nature: Your age and experience have granted you greater perspective and taught you to work with others to achieve greatness. You gain a +4 circumstance bonus on checks to Aid.

    Reach Spell [one-action] (concentrate, spellshape, wizard) You can extend the range of your spells. If the next action you use is to Cast a Spell that has a range, increase that spell’s range by 30 feet. As is standard for increasing spell ranges, if the spell normally has a range of touch, you extend its range to 30 feet.

    Widen Spell [one-action] (manipulate, spellshape, wizard) You manipulate the energy of your spell, causing it to affect a wider area. If the next action you use is to Cast a Spell that has an area of a burst, cone, or line and does not have a duration, increase the area of that spell. Add 5 feet to the radius of a burst that normally has a radius of at least 10 feet (a burst with a smaller radius is not affected). Add 5 feet to the length of a cone or line that is normally 15 feet long or smaller, and add 10 feet to the length of a larger cone or line.

    Wizard Spellcasting: You can cast arcane spells using the Cast a Spell activity. See the Spells section below for details on the spells you have prepared

    Spells:
    Ezren can cast the following spells. He can cast up to two 1st-level spells but must memorize them in advance. In addition to the spells he has already memorized (see front page), Ezren’s spellbook also contains ant haul, dizzying colors, frostbite, grease, mystic armor, message, read aura, sigil, and telekinetic projectile.

    Cantrips
    Caustic Blast [two-actions] (acid, cantrip, concentration, manipulate); Range 30 feet; Area 5-foot burst; Defense basic Reflex; Effect You fling a large glob of acid that immediately detonates, spraying nearby creatures. Creatures in the area take 1d8 acid damage with a basic Reflex save; on a critical failure, the creature also takes 1 persistent acid damage.

    Detect Magic [two-actions] (cantrip, concentrate, detection, manipulate) Area 30-foot emanation; Effect You send out a pulse that registers the presence of magic. You receive no information beyond the presence or absence of magic. You can choose to ignore magic you’re fully aware of, such as the magic items and ongoing spells of you and your allies.   You detect illusion magic only if that magic’s effect has a lower rank than the rank of your detect magic spell. However, items that have an illusion aura but aren’t deceptive in appearance (such as an invisibility potion) typically are detected normally.

    Electric Arc [two-actions] (cantrip, concentrate, electricity, manipulate) Range 30 feet; Targets 1 or 2 creatures; Defense basic Reflex; Effect An arc of lightning leaps from one target to another. Each target takes 2d4 electricity damage with a basic Reflex save.

    Light [two-actions] (cantrip, concentrate, light, manipulate); Range 120 feet; Duration until your next daily preparations; Effect You create an orb of light that sheds bright light in a 20-foot radius (and dim light for the next 20 feet) in a color you choose. If you create the light in the same space as a willing creature, you can attach the light to the creature, causing it to float near that creature as it moves. You can Sustain the spell to move the light up to 60 feet; you can attach or detach it from a creature as part of this movement You can Dismiss the spell. If you Cast the Spell while you already have four light spells active, you must choose one of the existing spells to end.

    Shield [one-action] (cantrip, concentrate, force); Duration until the start of your next turn; Effect You raise a magical shield of force. This counts as the Raise a Shield action, giving you a +1 circumstance bonus to AC until the start of your next turn (though it doesn’t require a hand to use), and allows you to use the Shield Block reaction. This shield has Hardness 5. You can use the spell’s reaction to reduce damage from any spell or magical effect, even if it doesn’t deal physical damage. After using the Shield Block action, this spell ends and you can’t use it again for 10 minutes.

    Shield Block [reaction] Trigger You would be damaged by a physical attack while your shield is conjured; Effect You interpose your magical shield between yourself and the attack, reducing the damage by 5. You take any remaining damage.

    1st
    Breathe Fire [two-actions] (concentrate, fire manipulate); Area 15-foot cone; Defense basic Reflex; Effect A gout of flame sprays from your mouth. You deal 2d6 fire damage to creatures in the area with a basic Reflex save.

    Force Barrage [one-action] to [three-actions] (concentrate, force, manipulate); Range 120 feet; Targets 1 creature; Effect You fire a shard of solidified magic toward a creature that you can see. It automatically hits and deals 1d4+1 force damage. For each additional action you use when Casting the Spell, increase the number of shards you shoot by one, to a maximum of three shards for 3 actions. You choose the target for each shard individually. If you shoot more than one shard at the same target, combine the damage before applying bonuses or penalties to damage, resistances, weaknesses, and so forth.

    Grim Tendrils [two-actions] (concentrate, manipulate, void); Area 30-foot line; Defense Fortitude; Effect Tendrils of darkness curl out from your fingertips and race through the air. You deal 2d4 void damage and 1 persistent bleed damage to living creatures in the line. Each living  creature in the line must attempt a Fortitude save. Critical Success The creature is unaffected. Success The creature takes half the void damage and no persistent bleed damage. Failure The creature takes full damage. Critical Failure The creature takes double void damage and double persistent bleed damage.

    Focus Spells
    Ezren can cast a school spell. School spells are a type of focus spell. It costs 1 Focus Point to cast a focus spell, and you start with a focus pool of 1 Focus Point. You refill your focus pool during your daily preparations, and you can regain 1 Focus Point by spending 10 minutes using the Refocus activity (Player Core 298) to study your spellbook or conduct arcane research.

    Hand of the Apprentice [one-action] (uncommon, attack, focus, manipulate, wizard); Range 500 feet; Targets 1 creature; Defense AC; Effect You take advantage of one of the most fundamental lessons of magic to levitate and propel your weapon. You hurl a held melee weapon with which you are trained at the target, making a spell attack roll. On a success, you deal the weapon’s damage as if you had hit with a melee Strike, but add your spellcasting attribute modifier to damage, rather than your Strength modifier. On a critical success, you deal double damage, and you add the weapon’s critical specialization effect. Regardless of the outcome, the weapon flies back to you and returns to your hand.

    Equipment:

    The following rules apply to Lem’s equipment.

    Agile (trait): The multiple attack penalty you take with this weapon on the second attack on your turn is –4 instead of –5, and –8 instead of –10 on the third and subsequent attacks in the turn. Backpack A backpack holds up to 4 Bulk of items, and the first 2 Bulk of these items don’t count against your Bulk limits. If you’re carrying or stowing the pack rather than wearing it on your back, its Bulk is light instead of negligible.

    Deadly (trait): On a critical hit, the weapon adds a weapon damage die of the listed size. Roll this after doubling the weapon’s damage.

    □Dread Ampoule, Lesser (alchemical, bomb, consumable, emotion, fear, mental, poison, splash) Activate [one-action] Strike; Effect This smoke-filled alchemical bomb deals 1d6 mental damage and 1 mental splash damage. On a hit, the target becomes frightened 1, or frightened 2 on a critical hit.

    Finesse (trait): You can use your Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength modifier on attack rolls using this melee weapon. You still calculate damage using Strength.

    Thieves’ Toolkit: You need these tools in order to Pick Locks or Disable Devices. If your thieves’ toolkit is broken, you can repair it by replacing the lock picks with replacement picks.

    Versatile (trait): A versatile weapon can be used to deal a different type of damage than its listed type. This trait indicates the alternate damage type. For instance, a piercing weapon with versatile S can deal piercing or slashing damage. You choose the damage type each time you attack

    Feats and Abilities:

    Lem’s feats and abilities are described below.

    Bard Spellcasting: You can cast occult spells using the Cast a Spell activity. As a bard, when you cast spells, your incantations might be musical riffs or clever limericks, your gestures might incorporate dance and dramatic pantomiming, and you might accompany your spellcasting by playing a musical instrument. See the Spells section for details on the spells Lem has in his repertoire.

    Fascinating Performance: When you Perform, compare your result to the Will DC of one observer. If you succeed, the target is fascinated by you for 1 round. If the observer is in a situation that demands immediate attention, such as combat, you must critically succeed to fascinate it and the Perform action gains the incapacitation trait. You must choose which creature you’re trying to fascinate before you roll your check, and the target is then temporarily immune for 1 hour.

    Gutsy Halfling: Your family line is known for keeping a level head and staving off fear when the chips were down. When you roll a success on a saving throw against an emotion effect, you get a critical success instead.

    □Halfling Luck (fortune) [free-action] Frequency once per day; Trigger You fail a skill check or saving throw; Effect You can reroll the triggering check, but you must use the new result, even if it’s worse than your first roll.

    Muse (Maestro): Your muse grants you the lingering composition focus spell and adds soothe to your spell repertoire.

    Keen Eyes: You gain a +2 circumstance bonus when using the Seek action to find undetected creatures within 30 feet of you. When you target an opponent who is concealed from you or hidden from you, reduce the DC of the flat check to 3 for a concealed target or 9 for a hidden one.

    Small: Lem is Small and can move through the spaces of Huge creatures, but can only grapple and use most other maneuvers against Medium or smaller creatures

    Spells:

    Lem can cast the following spells. He can cast his 1st-rank spells two times per day in any combination and can cast his cantrips at will.

    Cantrips:

    Daze [two-actions] (cantrip, concentrate, manipulate, mental, nonlethal); Range 60 feet; Targets 1 creature; Defense Will; Duration 1 round; Effect You push into the target’s mind and daze it with a mental jolt. The jolt deals 1d6 mental damage, with a basic Will save. If the target critically fails the save, it is also stunned 1.

    Figment [two-actions] (cantrip, concentrate, illusion, manipulate, subtle); Range 30 feet; Duration sustained; Effect You create a simple illusory sound or vision. A sound adds the auditory trait to the spell and the sound can’t include intelligible words or elaborate music. A vision adds the visual trait, can be no larger than a 5-foot cube, and is clearly crude and undetailed if viewed from within 15 feet. When you Cast or Sustain the Spell, you can attempt to Create a Diversion with the illusion, gaining a +2 circumstance bonus to your Deception check. If the attempt fails against a creature, that creature disbelieves the figment.

    Light [two-actions] (cantrip, concentrate, light, manipulate); Range 120 feet; Duration until your next daily preparations; Effect You create an orb of light that sheds bright light in a 20-foot radius (and dim light for the next 20 feet) in a color you choose. If you create the light in the same space as a willing creature, you can attach the light to the creature, causing it to float near that creature as it moves. You can Sustain the spell to move the light up to 60 feet; you can attach or detach it from a creature as part of this movement. You can Dismiss the spell. If you Cast the Spell while you already have four light spells active, you must choose one of the existing spells to end.

    Prestidigitation [two-actions] (cantrip, concentrate, manipulate); Range 10 feet; Targets 1 object (cook lit or tidy only); Duration sustained; Effect The simplest magic does your bidding. You can perform simple magical effects for as long as you Sustain the spell. Each time you Sustain the spell, you can choose one of four options.
    • Cook Cool, warm, or flavor 1 pound of nonliving material.
    • Lift Slowly lift an unattended object of light Bulk or less 1 foot off the ground.
    • Make Create a temporary object of negligible Bulk, made of congealed magical substance. The object looks artificial and is extremely fragile—it can’t be used as a tool, weapon, locus or cost for a spell.
    • Tidy Color, clean, or soil an object of light Bulk or less. You can affect an object of 1 Bulk with 10 rounds of concentration, and a larger object a 1 minute per Bulk.
    Prestidigitation can’t deal damage or cause adverse conditions. Any actual change to an object (beyond what is noted above) persists only as long as you Sustain the spell.

    Telekinetic Projectile [two-actions] (attack, cantrip, concentrate, manipulate); Range 30 feet; Targets 1 creature; Defense AC; Effect You hurl a loose, unattended object that is within range and that has 1 Bulk or less at the target. Make a spell attack roll against the target’s AC. If you hit, you deal 2d6 bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage—as appropriate for the object you hurled. No specific traits or magic properties of the hurled item affect the attack or the damage. Critical Success You deal double damage. Success You deal full damage.

    1st:
    Charm [two-actions] (concentrate, emotion, incapacitation, manipulate, mental, subtle); Range 30 feet; Targets 1 creature; Defense Will; Duration 1 hour; Effect To the target, your words are honey and your visage seems bathed in a dreamy haze. It must attempt a Will save, with a +4 circumstance bonus if you or your allies recently threatened it or used hostile actions against it. You can Dismiss the spell. If you use hostile actions against the target, the spell ends. When the spell ends, the target doesn’t necessarily realize it was charmed unless its friendship with you or the actions you convinced it to take clash with its expectations, meaning you could potentially convince the target to continue being your friend via mundane means. Critical Success The target is unaffected and aware you tried to charm it. Success The target is unaffected but thinks your spell was something harmless instead of charm, unless it identifies the spell (see Identifying Spells on page 303 of Pathfinder Player Core). Failure The target’s attitude becomes friendly toward you. If it was friendly, it becomes helpful. It can’t use hostile actions against you. Critical Failure The target’s attitude becomes helpful toward you, and it can’t use hostile actions against you.

    Fear [two-actions] (concentrate, emotion, fear, manipulate, mental); Range 30 feet; Targets 1 creature; Defense Will; Duration varies; Effect You plant fear in the target; it must attempt a Will save. Critical Success The target is unaffected. Success The target is frightened 1. Failure The target is frightened 2. Critical Failure The target is frightened 3 and fleeing for 1 round.

    Soothe [two-actions] (concentrate, emotion, healing, manipulate, mental); Range 30 feet; Targets 1 willing creature; Duration 1 minute; Effect You grace the target’s mind, boosting its mental defenses and healing its wounds. The target regains 1d10+4 Hit Points when you Cast the Spell and gains a +2 status bonus to saves against mental effects for the duration.

    Focus Spells:

    Lem can cast a number of composition spells, which are a type of focus spell, including a composition cantrip.

    Composition Spells You gain a pool of Focus Points that allow you  to cast the composition spells counter performance and lingering composition. Each use of these spells uses 1 Focus Point, and Lem has a focus pool of 2 Focus Points. You refill your focus pool during your daily preparations, and you can regain 1 Focus Point by spending 10 minutes using the Refocus activity (Player Core 298) to perform,  write a new composition, or otherwise engage your muse. You can also cast the composition cantrip courageous anthem; casting this cantrip does not expend a Focus Point.

    Counter Performance [reaction] (uncommon, bard, composition, concentrate, focus, fortune, mental); Trigger You or an ally within 60 feet rolls a saving throw against an auditory or visual effect; Area 60-foot emanation; Effect Your performance protects you and your allies. Roll a Performance check (auditory for an auditory trigger, visual for a visual trigger). You and allies in the area can use the better result between your Performance check and the saving throw.

    Courageous Anthem [one-action] (uncommon, bard, cantrip, composition, concentrate, emotion, mental); Area 60-foot emanation; Duration 1 round; Effect You inspire yourself and your allies with words or tunes of encouragement. You and all allies in the area gain a +1 status bonus to attack rolls, damage rolls, and saves against fear effects.

    Lingering Composition [free-action] (uncommon, bard, concentrate, focus, spellshape); Effect If your next action is to cast a cantrip composition with a duration of 1 round, attempt a Performance check. The DC is usually a standard-difficulty DC of a level equal to the highest- level target of your composition, but the GM can assign a different DC based on the circumstances. The effect depends on the result of your check. Critical Success The composition lasts 4 rounds. Success The composition lasts 3 rounds. Failure The composition lasts 1 round, but you don’t spend the Focus Point for casting this spell

    Equipment:
    The following rules apply to Merisiel’s equipment.

    Agile (trait): The multiple attack penalty you take on the second attack each round with this weapon is –4 instead of –5, and –8 instead of –10 on the third and any further attacks in the round.

    Backpack: A backpack can hold up to 4 Bulk worth of items. If you’re carrying or stowing the pack rather than wearing it on your back, its Bulk is light instead of negligible. The first 2 Bulk of items stowed in your backpack do not count against your Bulk limits (and are not included in your worn Bulk).

    Caltrops: You can scatter caltrops in an empty square adjacent to you with an Interact action. The first creature the moves into that square must succeed at a DC 14 Acrobatics check or take 1d4 piercing damage and 1 persistent bleed damage. A creature taking persistent bleed damage from caltrops takes a –5 foot penalty to its Speed. Spending an Interact action to pluck the caltrops free reduces the DC to stop the bleeding.

    Deadly (trait): When you critically succeed at an attack with this weapon, add the listed additional damage die. Roll this after doubling the weapon’s damage.

    Disarm (trait): You can use this weapon to Disarm with the Athletics  skill even if you don’t have a free hand. If you critically fail a check to Disarm using the weapon, you can drop the weapon to take the effects of failure rather than critical failure. On a critical success, you still need a free hand if you want to take the item.

    Finesse (trait): You can choose to use Dexterity instead of Strength on attack rolls with this melee weapon.

    Grappling Hook: You can throw a grappling hook with a rope tied to it to make a climb easier. To anchor a grappling hook, make a secret attack roll against a DC depending on the target (typically 20). On a success, your hook has a firm hold, but on a critical failure, the hook seems like it will hold but actually falls when you’re partway through.

    Piton: These small spikes can be used as anchors to make climbing easier. To affix a piton, you must hold it in one hand and use a hammer to drive it in with your other hand. You can attach a rope to the hammered piton so that you don’t fall all the way to the ground on a critical failure while Climbing.

    Thieves’ Toolkit: You need these tools in order to Pick Locks or Disable Devices. If your thieves’ toolkit is broken, you can repair it by replacing the lock picks with replacement picks; this doesn’t require using the Repair action. If you wear your thieves’ toolkit, you can draw and replace it as part of the action that uses it.

    Thrown (trait): You can throw this weapon as a ranged attack. A thrown weapon adds your Strength modifier to damage just like a melee weapon does. When this trait appears on a melee weapon, it also includes the range increment in feet.

    Versatile (trait): A versatile weapon can be used to deal an alternate damage type listed. For instance, a piercing weapon that has “versatile S” can be used to deal piercing or slashing damage. Choose the damage type each time you make an attack.

    Equipment:

    The following rules apply to Kyra’s equipment.
    Backpack: A backpack holds up to 4 Bulk of items, and the first 2 Bulk of these items don’t count against your Bulk limits. If you’re carrying or stowing the pack rather than wearing it on your back, its Bulk is light instead of negligible.

    Forceful (trait): When you attack with this weapon more than once on your turn, the second attack gains a +1 circumstance bonus to damage, and each attack after that gains a +2 circumstance bonus to damage.

    Healer’s Toolkit: This kit of bandages, herbs, and suturing tools is necessary for Medicine checks to Administer First Aid, Treat Disease, Treat Poison, or Treat Wounds. If you wear your healer’s toolkit, you can draw and replace the tools as part of the action that uses them.

    □Healing Potion, Minor (consumable, healing, magical, potion, vitality) Usage held in 1 hand; Activate [one-action] (manipulate); Effect A healing potion is a vial of a ruby-red liquid that imparts a tingling sensation as the drinker’s wounds heal rapidly. When you drink a healing potion, you regain 1d8 Hit Points.

    Reload 1 (trait): It takes 1 Interact action to reload this weapon.

    Sweep (trait): When you attack with this weapon, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus on your attack roll if you already attempted to attack a different target this turn using this weapon

    Feats and Abilities:
    Kyra’s feats and abilities are described below.

    Cleric Spellcasting: Your goddess Sarenrae grants you the ability to cast divine spells. You can cast divine spells using the Cast a Spell activity. See the Spells section for details on the spells you have prepared.

    Deity (Sarenrae): Sarenrae the Dawnflower is a goddess of healing,  honest redemption, and the sun. Your favored weapon is the scimitar and she grants you the fire domain. Sarenrae tasks her followers to destroy the Spawn of Rovagug, protect allies, provide aid to the sick and wounded, and to seek and allow redemption. Creating undead, lying, denying a repentant creature an opportunity for redemption, casting unholy spells, or failing to strike down evil are all anathema to Sarenrae. Repeatedly or flagrantly performing these anathema may cause Kyra to lose her divine spellcasting and divine font abilities.

    Doctrine (Cloistered Cleric): You gain the Domain Initiate feat (see focus spells).

    Haughty Obstinacy: Your powerful ego makes it harder for others to  order you around. If you roll a success on a saving throw against a mental effect that attempts to directly control your actions, you critically succeed instead. If a creature rolls a failure on a check to Coerce you using Intimidation, it gets a critical failure instead (so it can’t try to Coerce you again for 1 week).

    Sanctification (Holy): You gain the holy trait, which commits you to one side of a struggle over the souls of the planes and may be referenced in other abilities. The holy trait indicates a powerful devotion to altruism, helping others, and battling against unholy forces like fiends and undead. Some spells and abilities have the sanctified trait. When you use a sanctified ability you add your holy trait to it.

    Student of the Canon: If you roll a critical failure at a Religion check to Decipher Writing of a religious nature or to Recall Knowledge about the tenets of faiths, you get only a failure instead. If you roll a failure, you get a success instead, and if you roll a success, you get a critical success instead.

    Spells:
    Kyra can cast the following spells. She can cast her 1st-rank spells once per day each, except heal, which she can cast 4 times. She can cast her cantrips at will

    Daze [two-actions] (cantrip, concentrate, manipulate, mental, nonlethal); Range 60 feet; Targets 1 creature; Defense Will; Duration 1 round; Effect You push into the target’s mind and daze it with a mental jolt. The jolt deals 1d6 mental damage, with a basic Will save. If the target critically fails the save, it is also stunned 1.

    Divine Lance [two-actions] (attack, cantrip, concentrate, manipulate, sanctified, spirit); Range 60 feet; Targets 1 creature; Defense AC; Effect You unleash a beam of divine energy. Make a ranged spell attack against the target’s AC. On a hit, the target takes 2d4 spirit damage (double damage on a critical hit).

    Guidance [one-action] (cantrip, concentrate); Range 30 feet; Targets 1 creature; Duration until the start of your next turn; Effect You ask for the guidance of supernatural entities, granting the target a +1 status bonus to one attack roll, Perception check, saving throw, or skill check the target attempts before the duration ends. The target chooses which roll to use the bonus on before rolling. If the target uses the bonus, the spell ends. Either way, the target is then temporarily immune for 1 hour.

    Light [two-actions] (cantrip, concentrate, light, manipulate); Range 120 feet; Duration until your next daily preparations; Effect You create an orb of light that sheds bright light in a 20-foot radius (and dim light for the next 20 feet) in a color you choose. If you create the light in the same space as a willing creature, you can attach the light to the creature, causing it to float near that creature as it moves. You can Sustain the spell to move the light up to 60 feet; you can attach or detach it from a creature as part of this movement. You can Dismiss the spell. If you Cast the Spell while you already have four light spells active, you must choose one of the existing spells to end.

    Stabilize [two-actions] (cantrip, concentrate, healing, manipulate, vitality); Range 30 feet; Targets 1 dying creature; Effect Life energy shuts death’s door. The target loses the dying condition, though it remains unconscious at 0 Hit Points.

    1st
    Bless [two-actions] (aura, concentrate, manipulate, mental); Area 15-foot emanation; Duration 1 minute; Effect Blessings from beyond help your companions strike true. You and your allies gain a +1 status bonus to attack rolls while within the emanation. Once per round on subsequent turns, you can Sustain the spell to increase the emanation’s radius by 10 feet. Bless can counteract bane.

    Heal [one-action] to [three-actions] (healing, manipulate, vitality); Range varies (see spell text); Targets 1 willing living creature or 1 undead creature; Effect You channel vital energy to heal the living or damage the undead. If the target is a willing living creature, you restore 1d8 Hit Points. If the target is undead, you deal that amount of vitality damage to it, and it gets a basic Fortitude save. The number of actions you spend when Casting this Spell determines its targets, range, area, and other parameters.
    \[one-action] The spell has a range of touch.
    \[two-actions] (concentrate) The spell has a range of 30 feet. If you’re healing a living creature, increase the Hit Points restore by 8.
    \[three-actions] (concentrate) You disperse vital energy in a 30-foot emanation. This targets all living and undead creatures in the burst.

    Sanctuary [two-actions] (concentration, manipulate); Range touch; Targets 1 creature; Duration 1 minute; Effect You ward a creature with protective energy that deters attacks. Creatures attempting to attack the target must attempt a Will save each time. If the target uses a hostile action, the spell ends.
    Critical Success Sanctuary ends.
    Success The creature can attempt its attack and any other attacks against the target this turn.
    Failure The creature can’t attack the target and wastes the action. It can’t attempt further attacks against the target this turn.
    Critical Failure The creature wastes the action and can’t attempt to attack the target for the rest of sanctuary’s duration

    Focus Spells:
    Kyra’s can cast a domain spell. Domain spells are a type of focus spell. It costs 1 Focus Point to cast a focus spell, and you start with a focus pool of 1 Focus Point. You refill your focus pool during your daily preparations, and you can regain 1 Focus Point by spending 10 minutes using the Refocus activity (Player Core 298) to pray to Sarenrae or do service toward her causes.

    Domain Initiate (Fire): Your Domain Initiate feat grants you the fire ray domain spell, which you can cast by spending 1 Focus Point from your focus pool of 1.

    Fire Ray [two-actions] (uncommon, attack, cleric, concentrate, fire, focus, manipulate); Range 60 feet; Targets 1 creature; Defense AC; Duration until the end of the target’s next turn; Effect A blazing band of fire arcs through the air, lighting your opponent and the ground they stand upon on fire. Make a spell attack roll against the target’s AC. The ray deals 2d6 fire damage on a hit (or double damage on a critical hit). On any result other than a critical failure, the ground in the target’s space catches fire, dealing 1d6 fire damage to each creature that ends its turn in one of the squares.

    Equipment:
    The following rules apply to Lini’s equipment.

    Agile (trait): The multiple attack penalty you take with this weapon on the second attack on your turn is –4 instead of –5, and –8 instead of –10 on the third and subsequent attacks in the turn.

    □ Antidote, Lesser: (alchemical, consumable, elixir) Activate [one-action] (Interact); Effect Gain a +2 item bonus to Fortitude saves against poisons for 6 hours.

    Backpack: A backpack holds up to 4 Bulk of items, and the first 2 Bulk of these items don’t count against your Bulk limits. If you’re carrying or stowing the pack rather than wearing it on your back, its Bulk is light instead of negligible.

    Finesse (trait): You can use your Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength modifier on attack rolls using this melee weapon. You still calculate damage using Strength.

    □ Healing Potion, Minor (consumable, healing, magical, potion, vitality) Usage held in 1 hand; Activate [one-action] (manipulate); Effect A healing potion is a vial of a ruby-red liquid that imparts a tingling sensation as the drinker’s wounds heal rapidly. When you drink a healing potion, you regain 1d8 Hit Points.

    Healer’s Toolkit: This kit of bandages, herbs, and suturing tools is necessary for Medicine checks to Administer First Aid, Treat Disease, Treat Poison, or Treat Wounds. If you wear your healer’s toolkit, you can draw and replace the tools as part of the action that uses them.

    Trip: You can use this weapon to Trip with the Athletics skill even if you don’t have a free hand. This uses the weapon’s reach and adds the weapon’s item bonus to attack rolls as an item bonus to the Athletics check. If you critically fail a check to Trip using the weapon, you can drop the weapon to take the effects of a failure instead of a critical failure

    Feats and Abilities:
    Lini’s feats and abilities are described below.

    Anathema: You must not commit wanton cruelty to animals or kill animals unnecessarily (this doesn’t prevent you from defending yourself against animals or killing them cleanly for food), despoil natural places, consume more natural resources than you require to live comfortably, or teach the Wildsong to non-druids. If you flagrantly or repeatedly violate these prohibitions, you might lose your primal spellcasting and animal companion abilities.

    Animal Companion: The young snow leopard Droogami serves as your companion and protector. You can use the Command an Animal action to give her two actions. Because Droogami is a loyal companion, you do not have to attempt a Nature check to convince her to listen to you.

    Animal Empathy: You can use Diplomacy to Make an Impression on animals and to make very simple Requests of them. In most cases, wild animals will give you time to make your case.

    Assurance (fortune) Even in the worst circumstances, you can perform basic tasks. You can forgo rolling a skill check for Forest Lore to instead receive a result of 10 + your proficiency bonus (do not apply any other bonuses, penalties, or modifiers).

    Druid Spellcasting: You can cast primal spells using the Cast a Spell activity. See the Spells section for details on the spells you can cast.

    Gnome Obsession: Lini obsessively collects sticks from every forest she visits. You gain the Additional Lore feat and the Assurance feat for the chosen Lore. Lini has chosen Forest Lore for these feats. As gnome obsessions can come and go quickly, you can retrain Gnome Obsession to a different Lore subcategory in 1 day of downtime.

    Low-Light Vision: You can see in dim light as though it were bright light, and you ignore the concealed condition due to dim light.

    Natural Medicine: You can use Nature instead of Medicine to Treat Wounds. While in the wilderness, you might have access to fresher ingredients that grant a +2 circumstance bonus to your check (at GM’s discretion).

    Sensate Gnome: You see all colors as brighter, hear all sounds as richer,   and especially smell all scents with incredible detail. You gain a special sense: imprecise scent with a range of 30 feet. This means you can use your sense of smell to determine the exact location of a creature. The GM will usually double the range if you’re downwind from the creature or halve the range if you’re upwind. In addition, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to Perception checks whenever you’re trying to locate an undetected creature that is within the range of your scent.

    Small: Lini is Small and can move through the spaces of Huge creatures, but can only grapple and use most other maneuvers against Medium or smaller creatures

    Shield Actions:
    While you have your shield equipped, you can take the following actions.

    Raise Shield [one-action] While wielding a shield, you position it to protect yourself until the beginning of your next turn. This grants you a +1 circumstance bonus to AC, and you can use the Shield Block reaction.

    Shield Block [reaction] Trigger You would be damaged by a physical attack while your shield is raised; Effect You snap your shield in place to ward off a blow. Your shield prevents you from taking an amount of damage up to the shield’s Hardness (in the case of Lini’s buckler, 3). You and the shield each take any remaining damage, possibly breaking or destroying the shield (the shield gains the broken condition after taking 3 or more damage and is destroyed once it’s taken 6 damage)

    Spells:
    Lini can cast the following spells. She can cast each of her 1st-rank spells once per day and can cast her cantrips at will.

    Cantrips
    Detect Magic [two-actions] (cantrip, concentrate, detection, manipulate) Area 30-foot emanation; Effect You send out a pulse that registers the presence of magic. You receive no information beyond the presence or absence of magic. You can choose to ignore magic you’re fully aware of, such as the magic items and ongoing spells of you and your allies. You detect illusion magic only if that magic’s effect has a lower rank than the rank of your detect magic spell. However, items that have an illusion aura but aren’t deceptive in appearance (such as an invisibility potion) typically are detected normally.

    Electric Arc [two-actions] (cantrip, concentrate, electricity, manipulate) Range 30 feet; Targets 1 or 2 creatures; Defense basic Reflex; Effect An arc of lightning leaps from one target to another. Each target takes 2d4 electricity damage with a basic Reflex save.

    Ignition[two-actions] (attack, cantrip, concentrate, fire, manipulate) Range 30 feet; Targets 1 creature; Defense AC; Effect You snap your fingers and point at a target, which begins to smolder. Make a spell attack roll against the target’s AC, dealing 2d4 fire damage on a hit. If the target is within your melee reach, you can choose to make a melee spell attack with the flame instead of a ranged spell attack, which increases all the spell’s damage dice to d6’s.
    Critical Success The target takes double damage and 1d4 persistent fire damage.
    Success The target takes full damage.

    Stabilize [two-actions] (cantrip, concentrate, healing, manipulate, vitality);Range 30 feet; Targets 1 dying creature; Effect Life energy shuts death’s door. The target loses the dying condition, though it remains unconscious at 0 Hit Points.

    Tangle Vine [two-actions] (attack, cantrip, concentrate, plant) Range 30 feet; Targets 1 creature; Effect A vine appears from thin air, flicking from your hand and lashing itself to the target. Attempt a spell attack roll against the target.
    Critical Success The target gains the immobilized condition and takes a –10-foot circumstance penalty to its Speeds for 1 round. It can attempt to Escape against your spell DC to remove the penalty and the immobilized condition.
    Success The target takes a –10-foot circumstance penalty to its Speeds for 1 round. It can attempt to Escape against your spell DC to remove the penalty.
    Failure The target is unaffected

    1st
    Heal [one-action] to [three-actions] (healing, manipulate, vitality) Range varies (see spell text): Targets 1 willing living creature or 1 undead creature; Effect You channel vital energy to heal the living or damage the undead. If the target is a willing living creature, you restore 1d8 Hit Points. If the target is undead, you deal that amount of vitality damage to it, and it gets a basic Fortitude save. The number of actions you spend when Casting this Spell determines its targets, range, area, and other parameters.
    \[one-action] The spell has a range of touch.
    \[two-actions] (concentrate) The spell has a range of 30 feet. If you’re healing a living creature, increase the Hit Points restore by 8.
    \[three-actions] (concentrate) You disperse vital energy in a 30-foot emanation. This targets all living and undead creatures in the burst.

    Runic Body [two-actions] (concentrate, manipulate) Range touch; Targets 1 willing creature; Duration 1 minute; Effect Glowing runes appear on the target’s body. All its unarmed attacks become +1 striking unarmed attacks, gaining a +1 item bonus to attack rolls and increasing the number of damage dice to two

    Focus Spells:
    Lini can cast an order spell. Order spells are a type of focus spell. It costs 1 Focus Point to cast a focus spell, and you start with a focus pool of 1 Focus Point. You refill your focus pool during your daily preparations, and you can regain 1 Focus Point by spending 10 minutes using the Refocus activity (Player Core 298) to commune with local nature spirits or otherwise tend to the wilderness in a way befitting your order.
    Heal Animal [one-action] to [two-actions] (uncommon, druid, focus, healing, manipulate, vitality) Range touch or 30 feet (see text); Targets 1 creature; Effect You heal an animal’s wounds, restoring 1d8 Hit Points to the target. The number of actions spent Casting this Spell determines its effect.
    \[one-action] The spell has a range of touch.
    \[two-actions] (concentrate) The spell has a range of 30 feet and restores an additional 8 Hit Points to the target.

    Equipment:
    The following rules apply to Feiya’s equipment.

    Agile (trait): The multiple attack penalty you take on the second attack each round with this weapon is –4 instead of –5, and –8 instead of –10 on the third and any further attacks in the round.

    Backpack: A backpack can hold up to 4 Bulk worth of items. If you’re carrying or stowing the pack rather than wearing it on your back, its Bulk is light instead of negligible. The first 2 Bulk of items stowed in your backpack do not count against your Bulk limits (and are not included in your worn Bulk).

    Finesse (trait): You can use your Dexterity instead of Strength to calculate your attack bonus (but not damage rolls) with this melee weapon.

    Reload (trait): This weapon requires you to use 1 Interact action to reload before it can be fired again.

    □Scroll of Pet Cache: When holding this scroll, you can cast pet cache (see Spells). After you Cast the Spell, the scroll is destroyed.

    Thrown (trait): You can throw this weapon as a ranged attack. A thrown weapon adds your Strength modifier to damage just like a melee weapon does. When this trait appears on a melee weapon, it also includes the range increment in feet.

    Two-Hand (trait): This weapon can be wielded with two hands. Doing so changes its weapon damage die to the indicated value.

    Versatile (trait): A versatile weapon can be used to deal an alternate damage type listed. For instance, a piercing weapon that has “versatile S” can be used to deal piercing or slashing damage. Choose the damage type each time you make an attack.

    Feats and Abilities:
    Feiya’s feats and abilities are described below.

    Oddity Identification (general, skill): When you become aware of a magical effect or see a spell being cast, you can immediately determine if it twists minds (with the mental trait), fights against fortune (with the fortune or misfortune trait), or reveals secrets (with the detection, prediction, revelation, or scrying traits). At the GM’s discretion, similar effects can also fall into these categories. When you Identify Magic or Recall Knowledge to learn more about these effects, you can always use Occultism without penalty and gain a +2 circumstance bonus.

    Patron (The Resentment): Feiya’s patron is a mysterious entity known to her only as the Resentment. It grants her the evil eye hex cantrip and teaches Daji enfeeble. It also grants Daji the familiar of ongoing misery familiar ability.

    Schooled in Secrets (general, skill): You notice the signs and symbols that members of mystery cults and other secret societies use to declare their affiliation to fellow members. You can use Occultism in place of Diplomacy to Gather Information about such groups and in place of Deception to Impersonate a member of these groups. If you belong to a secret cult, lodge, sect, or similar organization, you automatically recognize members of your group unless they are specifically attempting to conceal their presence from you. They also recognize your standing unless you are specifically concealing it.

    Witch Spellcasting: Your otherworldly patron has granted you a familiar to teach you magic. You can cast occult spells using the Cast a Spell activity. See the Spells section below for details on the spells you can cast.

    Familiar:
    Feiya’s familiar, Daji, is more powerful than other familiars. If Feiya spends 1 action to command Daji, he gains 2 actions to use during the round. He can’t use reactions.
    Daji, 5HP, 15AC, Speed 25 ft., low-light vision, scent (imprecise) 30 ft

    Familiar of Ongoing Misery: Daji seems hostile to all creatures other than you, hissing at them if they get too near. When you Cast or Sustain a hex, Daji can curse a creature within 15 feet of him, prolonging the duration of any negative conditions affecting it by 1 round. This is a curse effect. This prolongs only conditions with a timed duration (such as “1 round” or “until the end of your next turn”) and doesn’t prevent conditions from being removed by other means.

    Scent: Daji gains scent (imprecise, 30 feet).

    Share Senses: Once every 10 minutes, you can use a single action, which has the concentrate trait, to project your senses into Daji. When you do, you lose all sensory information from your own body, but can sense through Daji’s body for up to 1 minute. You can Dismiss this effect.

    Speech: Daji speaks and understands Common

    Spells:
    Feiya can cast the following spells. In addition to the spells Feiya has prepared today (see the front page), Daji also knows charm, daze, figment, ill omen, mindlink, phantom pain, prestidigitation, read aura, and sigil

    Cantrips
    Detect Magic [two-actions] (cantrip, concentrate, detection, manipulate) Area 30-foot emanation; Effect You send out a pulse that registers the presence of magic. You receive no information beyond the presence or absence of magic. You can choose to ignore magic you’re fully aware of, such as the magic items and ongoing spells of you and your allies. You detect illusion magic only if that magic’s effect has a lower rank than the rank of your detect magic spell. However, items that have an illusion aura but aren’t deceptive in appearance (such as an invisibility potion) typically are detected normally.

    Forbidding Ward [two-actions] (cantrip, concentrate, manipulate) Range 30 feet; Targets 1 ally and 1 enemy; Duration sustained up to 1 minute; Effect You ward an ally against the attacks and hostile spells from the target enemy. The target ally gains a +1 status bonus to Armor Class and saving throws against the target enemy’s attacks, spells, and other effects.

    Light [two-actions] (cantrip, concentrate, light, manipulate); Range 120 feet; Duration until your next daily preparations; Effect You create an orb of light that sheds bright light in a 20-foot radius (and dim light for the next 20 feet) in a color you choose. If you create the light in the same space as a willing creature, you can attach the light to the creature, causing it to float near that creature as it moves. You can Sustain the spell to move the light up to 60 feet; you can attach or detach it from a creature as part of this movement. You can Dismiss the spell. If you Cast the Spell while you already have four light spells active, you must choose one of the existing spells to end.

    Shield [one-action] (cantrip, concentrate, force); Duration until the start of your next turn; Effect You raise a magical shield of force. This counts as the Raise a Shield action, giving you a +1 circumstance bonus to AC until the start of your next turn (though it doesn’t require a hand to use), and allows you to use the Shield Block reaction. This shield has Hardness 5. You can use the spell’s reaction to reduce damage from any spell or magical effect, even if it doesn’t deal physical damage. After using the Shield Block action, this spell ends and you can’t use it again for 10 minutes. Shield Block [reaction] Trigger You would be damaged by a physical attack while your shield is conjured; Effect You interpose your magical shield between yourself and the attack, reducing the damage by 5. You take any remaining damage.

    Telekinetic Projectile [two-actions] (attack, cantrip, concentrate, manipulate); Range 30 feet; Targets 1 creature; Defense AC; Effect You hurl a loose, unattended object that is within range and that has 1 Bulk or less at the target. Make a spell attack roll against the target’s AC. If you hit, you deal 2d6 bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage—as appropriate for the object you hurled. No specific traits or magic properties of the hurled item affect the attack or the damage.
    Critical Success You deal double damage.
    Success You deal full damage.

    1st
    Enfeeble [two-actions] (concentrate, manipulate) Range 30 feet; Targets 1 creature; Defense Fortitude; Duration varies; Effect You sap the target’s strength, depending on its Fortitude save.
    Critical Success The target is unaffected.
    Success The target is enfeebled 1 until the start of your next turn.
    Failure The target is enfeebled 2 for 1 minute.
    Critical Failure The target is enfeebled 3 for 1 minute.

    Pet Cache [one-action] (extradimensional, manipulate); Range touch; Target 1 willing creature that is your familiar; Duration 8 hours; Effect You open your cloak or create a gap with your hands, drawing the target into a pocket dimension just large enough for its basic comfort. No other creature can enter this extradimensional space, and the target can bring along objects only if they were designed to be worn by a creature of its kind. The space has enough air, food, and water to sustain the target for the duration. You can Dismiss the spell. The spell also ends if you die or enter an extradimensional space. When the spell ends, the target reappears in the nearest unoccupied space (outside of any extradimensional space you may have entered).

    Soothe [two-actions] (concentrate, emotion, healing, manipulate, mental); Range 30 feet; Targets 1 willing creature; Duration 1 minute; Effect You grace the target’s mind, boosting its mental defenses and healing its wounds. The target regains 1d10+4 Hit Points when you Cast the Spell and gains a +2 status bonus to saves against mental effects for the duration

    Focus Spells:
    Feiya can cast a number of hex spells, including a hex cantrip. Hex spells are a type of focus spell. It costs 1 Focus Point to cast a focus spell, and you start with a focus pool of 2 Focus Points. You refill your focus pool during your daily preparations, and you can regain 1 Focus Point by spending 10 minutes using the Refocus activity (Player Core 298) to commune with your familiar.
    Hex cantrips are special hexes that don’t cost Focus Points, so you can cast them as often as you like, though you can still use only one hex each round. Hexes: You gain a pool of Focus Points that allows you to cast your witch hexes: cackle and phase familiar. Each use of these spells uses 1 Focus Point, and you have a total pool of 2 Focus Points. You can also use the hex cantrip evil eye without spending a Focus Point. You can cast only one hex per turn.

    Cackle [free-action] (uncommon, concentrate, focus, hex, witch); Effect With a quick burst of laughter, you prolong a magical effect you created. You Sustain a Spell.

    Evil Eye [one-action] (uncommon, cantrip, curse, hex, manipulate, witch); Range 30 feet; Targets 1 creature; Defense Will; Duration sustained up to 1 minute; Effect Your patron’s resentment manifests in a baleful, envious gaze. The target becomes sickened 1 if it fails a Will save (or sickened 2 on a critical failure). This condition value can’t be reduced below 1 while the spell is active and you can see the target.

    Phase Familiar [reaction] (uncommon, focus, hex, manipulate, witch); Trigger Your familiar would take damage; Range 60 feet; Targets your familiar; Effect Your patron momentarily recalls your familiar to the ether, shifting it from its solid, physical form into a ghostly version of itself. Against the triggering damage, your familiar gains resistance 5 to all damage and is immune to precision damage.

    Equipment
    The following rules apply to Harsk’s equipment.

    Agile (trait): The multiple attack penalty you take with this weapon on the second attack on your turn is –4 instead of –5, and –8 instead of –10 on the third and subsequent attacks in the turn. (See Harsk’s hunter’s edge class ability, which further reduces this penalty against his designated Prey.)

    Backpack: A backpack holds up to 4 Bulk of items, and the first 2 Bulk of these items don’t count against your Bulk limits. If you’re carrying or stowing the pack rather than wearing it on your back, its Bulk is light instead of negligible.

    Dwarf (trait): Dwarves craft and use these weapons.

    Grappling Hook: You can throw a grappling hook with a rope tied to it to make a climb easier. To anchor a grappling hook, make a ranged attack roll using your simple weapon proficiency against a DC depending on the target, typically at least DC 20. This attack has the secret trait. On a success, your hook has a firm hold, but on a critical failure, the hook seems like it will hold but actually falls when you’re partway up.

    Parry (trait): This weapon can be raised defensively to block attacks. While wielding this weapon, you may use an Interact action to position it defensively, gaining a +1 circumstance bonus to AC until the start of your next turn.

    Reload 2 (trait): It takes 2 Interact actions to reload this weapon.

    Repair Toolkit: A repair toolkit allows you to perform simple repairs while traveling. It contains a portable anvil, tongs, woodworking tools, a whetstone, and oils for conditioning leather and wood. You can use a repair toolkit to Repair items using the Crafting skill.

    Sweep (trait): When you attack with this weapon, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus on your attack roll if you already attempted to attack a different target this turn using this weapon.

    Thrown (trait): You can throw this weapon as a ranged attack. A thrown weapon adds your Strength modifier to damage just like a melee weapon does. When this trait appears on a melee weapon, it also includes the range increment in feet.

    Two-Hand (trait): This weapon can be wielded with two hands, changing its weapon damage die to the indicated value. This change applies to all the weapon’s damage dice.

    Versatile (trait): A versatile weapon can be used to deal a different type of damage than its listed type. For instance, a slashing weapon that has “versatile B” can be used to deal slashing or bludgeoning damage. Choose the damage type each time you make an attack

    Feats and Abilities:
    Harsk’s feats and abilities are described below.

    Darkvision: You can see in the dark as well as you can in bright light, though your darkvision is in black and white.

    Dwarven Weapon Familiarity: You are trained with dwarven waraxes.

    Forager: While using Survival to Subsist, if you roll any result worse than a success, you get a success. On a success, you can provide subsistence living for yourself and four additional creatures, and on a critical success, you can take care of twice as many additional creatures. You can choose to support half the number of creatures with a comfortable living

    Hunt Prey [one-action] (concentrate) You designate a single creature you can see or hear, or that you are currently tracking during exploration as your prey. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to Perception checks when you Seek your prey and a +2 bonus to Survival checks when you Track your prey. You also ignore the penalty for making ranged attacks within your second range increment against the prey you’re hunting. You can only have one creature designated as your prey at a time, and designating a new creature as your prey causes any previously marked creature to lose the designation. Your designation otherwise lasts until your next daily preparations.

    Hunter’s Edge (Flurry): Your multiple attack penalty for attacks against your hunted prey is –3 (–2 with an agile weapon) on your second attack of the turn and –6 (–4 with an agile weapon) on your third or subsequent attack of the turn.

    Monster Hunter: You quickly assess your prey and apply what you know. As part of the action used to Hunt your Prey, you can attempt a check to Recall Knowledge about your prey. When you critically succeed at identifying your hunted prey with Recall Knowledge, you note a weakness in the creature’s defenses in addition to any other benefits. You and allies you tell gain a +1 circumstance bonus to your next attack roll against that prey. You can give bonuses from Monster Hunter only once per day against a particular creature.

    Strong-Blooded Dwarf: You gain poison resistance 1, and each of your successful saving throws against a poison affliction reduces its stage by 2, or by 1 for a virulent poison. Each critical success against an ongoing poison reduces its stage by 3, or 2 for a virulent poison.

    Equipment:
    The following rules apply to Fumbus’s equipment (including his prepared bombs and alchemical items).
    □□ Acid Flask, Lesser A thrown acid flask deals 1 acid damage, 1d6 persistent acid damage, and 1 acid splash damage.

    Agile (trait) The multiple attack penalty you take on the second attack each round with this weapon is –4 instead of –5, and –8 instead of –10 on the third and any further attacks in the round.

    □□□□ Alchemist’s Fire, Lesser A thrown flask of alchemist’s fire deals 1d8 fire damage, 1 persistent fire damage, and 1 fire splash damage.

    Alchemist’s Toolkit This mobile collection of vials and chemicals can be used for simple alchemical tasks. If you wear your alchemist’s toolkit, you can draw and replace them as part of the action that uses them.

    Backpack A backpack can hold up to 4 Bulk worth of items. If you’re carrying or stowing the pack rather than wearing it on your back, its Bulk is light instead of negligible. The first 2 Bulk of items stowed in your backpack do not count against your Bulk limits (and are not included in your current Bulk).

    Backstabber (trait) When you hit an off-guard creature, this weapon deals 1 additional precision damage.

    □ Cheetah’s Elixir, Lesser (alchemical, consumable, elixir) Upon drinking this elixir, you gain a +5 status bonus to your Speed for 1 minute. This was not crafted during daily preparations.

    □□ Elixir of Life, Minor Upon drinking this elixir, you regain 1d6 Hit Points and gain a +1 item bonus to saving throws against diseases and poisons for 10 minutes.

    Finesse (trait) You can use your Dexterity instead of Strength to calculate your attack bonus (but not damage rolls) with this melee weapon.

    Goblin (trait) People of the goblin ancestry craft and use these weapons.

    Repair Toolkit You need a thieves’ toolkit to Pick Locks or Disable Devices (of some types) using the Thievery skill. If your thieves’ toolkit is broken, you can repair it by replacing the lock picks with replacement picks appropriate to your toolkit; this doesn’t require using the Repair action. If you wear your thieves’ toolkit, you can draw and replace it as part of the action that uses it.

    Splash (trait) If an attack with a splash weapon fails, succeeds, or critically succeeds, all creatures within 5 feet of the target (including the target) take the listed splash damage. On a failure (but not a critical failure), the target of the attack still takes the splash damage. Add splash damage together with the initial damage against the target before applying the target’s weaknesses or resistances. You don’t multiply splash damage on a critical hit. When you use a weapon or effect with the splash trait, you don’t add your Strength modifier to the damage roll.

    Thieves’ Toolkit You need these tools in order to Pick Locks or Disable Devices.

    Thrown (trait) You can throw this weapon as a ranged attack.

    □□□□□□ Versatile Vial (alchemical, bomb, consumable, infused, splash): When used as a bomb, this deals 1d6 acid, cold, electricity or fire damage and 1 splash damage of the same type. See the Alchemical Abilities section for other uses.

    Alchemical Abilities:
    Alchemical Crafting You can use the Craft activity to create alchemical items.

    Alchemy During your daily preparations, you spend some time to create alchemical items that can be used over the course of the day. You don’t need to attempt a Crafting check to do this, you can use an alchemist’s toolkit instead of an alchemist’s lab, and you ignore both the number of days typically required to create the items and any alchemical raw materials requirements. You can Craft up to 8 items; each item must be in your formula book, have an item level equal to or lower than your level, and have the consumable trait. These items have the infused trait and remain potent for 24 hours or until your next daily preparations, whichever comes first. Fumbus has already crafted his typical 8 items (see Equipment). You can automatically identify alchemical items that you have the formula for.

    Quick Alchemy [one-action] (manipulate) Requirements You’re either holding or wearing an alchemist’s toolkit and you have a free hand; Effect You can either use up a versatile vial to make another alchemical consumable at a moment’s notice or create an especially short- lived versatile vial. Any effect created by an item made with Quick Alchemy that would have a duration longer than 10 minutes lasts for 10 minutes instead.
    • Create Consumable You expend one of your versatile vials to create a single alchemical consumable item of your level or lower that’s in your formula book. You don’t have to spend the normal monetary cost in alchemical raw materials or need to attempt a Crafting check. This item has the infused trait, but it remains potent only until the start of your next turn.
    • Quick Vial You create a versatile vial that can be used only as a bomb or for the versatile vial option from your research field (it can’t be used to create a consumable, for example). This item has the infused trait, but it remains potent only until the end of your current turn.

    Versatile Vials You know how to prepare fast-acting chemicals into versatile vials, special items that can be used as bombs and be turned into other alchemical items by introducing special reagents. During your daily preparations, you can create up to 6 versatile vials. For every 10 minutes you spend in exploration mode, you regain 2 vials; this doesn’t prevent you from participating in other exploration activities.
    Versatile vials are infused items, and are destroyed if not used by the next time you make your daily preparations. A vial you create is always the highest type you could Craft. See the Equipment section for statistics on using a versatile vial as a bomb. You can also use vials for Quick Alchemy (see above).
    You can store all your versatile vials within your alchemist’s toolkit, with no increase to its Bulk. Though versatile vials are physical objects, they can’t be duplicated or preserved in any way

    Feats and Abilities
    Fumbus’s feats and abilities are described below.

    Charhide Goblin You gain fire resistance 1 (already factored into Fumbus’s statistics). Your flat check to remove any persistent fire damage is DC 10 instead of DC 15, which is reduced to DC 5 if another creature uses a particularly appropriate action to help.

    Darkvision You can see in the dark as well as you can in bright light, though your darkvision is in black and white

    Formula Book You have a book of alchemical formulas for eight different alchemical items. These appear in the Alchemical Items section below.

    Goblin Weapon Familiarity You are trained with the dogslicer and horsechopper.

    Quick Bomber [one-action] You keep your bombs in easy-to-reach pouches and have learned to draw them without thinking. You Interact to draw a bomb, draw a versatile vial, or use Quick Alchemy to create a bomb, then Strike with the bomb.

    Research Field (Bomber) When throwing an alchemical bomb with the splash trait, you can deal splash damage to only your primary target instead of the usual splash area. Additionally, when you Strike with a versatile vial, you can choose to have it deal cold, electricity or fire damage instead of acid damage.

    Alchemical Items:
    You know how to craft the following alchemical items.

    Acid Flask, Lesser (acid, alchemical, bomb, consumable, splash) Level 1; Usage held in 1 hand; Bulk L; Activate [one-action] (Strike); Effect This flask filled with corrosive acid deals 1 acid damage, 1d6 persistent acid damage, and 1 acid splash damage.

    Alchemist’s Fire, Lesser (alchemical, bomb, consumable, fire, splash) Level 1; Usage held in 1 hand; Bulk L; Activate [one-action] (Strike); Effect Alchemist’s fire is a combination of several volatile liquids, typically stored in a sealed flask, that ignite when exposed to air. Alchemist’s fire deals 1d8 fire damage, 1 persistent fire damage, and 1 fire splash damage.

    Bottled Lightning, Lesser (alchemical, bomb, consumable, electricity, splash) Level 1; Usage held in 1 hand; Bulk L; Activate [one-action] (Strike); Effect Bottled lightning is packed with volatile reagents that create a blast of electricity when exposed to air. Bottled lightning deals 1d6 electricity damage and 1 persistent electricity damage, and on a hit, the target becomes off-guard until the start of your next turn.

    Cheetah’s Elixir, Lesser (alchemical, consumable, elixir) Level 1; Usage held in 1 hand; Bulk L; Activate [one-action] (manipulate); Effect Enzymatic compounds in this elixir strengthen and excite the muscles in your legs. You gain a +5-foot status bonus to your Speed for 1 minute.

    Dread Ampoule, Lesser (alchemical, bomb, consumable, emotion, fear, mental, poison, splash) Level 1; Usage held in 1 hand; Bulk L; Activate [one-action] (Strike); Effect This flask is filled with a murky purple gas that briefly interferes with normal brain activity. A dread ampoule deals 1d6 mental damage and 1 mental splash damage. On a hit, the target becomes frightened 1, or frightened 2 on a critical hit.

    Eagle-Eye Elixir, Lesser (alchemical, consumable, elixir) Level 1; Usage held in 1 hand; Bulk L; Activate [one-action] (manipulate); Effect After you drink this elixir, you gain a +1 item bonus to Perception checks (+2 to find secret doors and traps) for the next hour.

    Elixir of Life, Minor (alchemical, consumable, elixir, healing) Level 1; Usage held in 1 hand; Bulk L; Activate [one-action] (manipulate); Effect Elixirs of life accelerate the body’s natural healing processes and immune system. Upon drinking this elixir, you regain 1d6 Hit Points and gain a +1 item bonus to saving throws against diseases and poisons for 10 minutes.

    Versatile Vial (alchemical, bomb, consumable, infused, splash) Usage held in 1 hand; Bulk –; Activate [one-action] (Strike); Effect A versatile vial deals 1d6 acid, cold, electricity or fire damage and 1 splash damage of the same type when used as a bomb. It can also be used for other purposes as listed in the Alchemical Abilities section.

    Conditions
    Your alchemical bombs deal persistent damage.

    PERSISTENT DAMAGE
    Persistent damage comes from effects like acid, being on fire, or many other situations. It appears as “X persistent [type] damage,” where “X” is the amount of damage dealt and “[type]” is the damage type. Instead of taking persistent damage immediately, you take it at the end of each of your turns as long as you have the condition, rolling any damage dice anew each time. After you take persistent damage, roll a DC 15 flat check to see if you recover from the persistent damage. If you succeed, the condition ends.

    The following rules apply to Amiri’s equipment.

    Backpack A backpack can hold up to 4 Bulk worth of items. If you’re carrying or stowing the pack rather than wearing it on your back, its Bulk is light instead of negligible. The first 2 Bulk of items stowed in your backpack do not count against your Bulk limits (and are not included in your worn Bulk).

    Clumsy 1 (condition) You take a –1 status penalty to Dexterity-based checks and DCs, such as AC, Reflex saves, ranged attack rolls, and skill checks using Acrobatics, Stealth, and Thievery. You are clumsy 1 while you wield your Large bastard sword (this is not reflected in your AC, skills, or saves).

    □□Elixir of Life, Minor (alchemical, consumable, elixir, healing) Activate [one-action] (manipulate); Effect Upon drinking this elixir, you regain 1d6 Hit Points and gain a +1 item bonus to saving throws against diseases and poisons for 10 minutes.

    Grappling Hook You can throw a grappling hook with a rope tied to it to make a climb easier. To anchor a grappling hook, make a secret attack roll against a DC depending on the target (typically 20). On a success, your hook has a firm hold, but on a critical failure, the hook seems like it will hold but actually falls when you’re partway through.

    Thrown (trait) You can throw this weapon as a ranged attack. A thrown weapon adds your Strength modifier to damage just like a melee weapon does. When this trait appears on a melee weapon, it also includes the range increment in feet.

    Two-Hand (trait) This weapon can be wielded with two hands, changing its weapon damage die to the indicated value

    Feats and Abilities:
    Amiri’s feats and abilities are described below.
    Demoralize [one-action] (auditory, concentrate, emotion, fear, mental, rage) You attempt to frighten a creature within 30 feet of you who you’re aware of. Attempt an Intimidation check against the target’s Will DC. If the target doesn’t understand the language you are speaking, or you’re not speaking a language, you take a –4 circumstance penalty to the check. No matter the result, the target is temporarily immune to your attempts to Demoralize it for 10 minutes.
    Critical Success The target becomes frightened 2.
    Success The target becomes frightened 1.

    Diehard You are harder to kill than most. You die from the dying condition at dying 5, rather than dying 4.

    Giant Instinct Your rage gives you the raw power of a giant. You can use a weapon that is built for a Large creature, though you gain the clumsy 1 condition while you do so because of the weapon’s unwieldy size.

    Intimidating Glare You can Demoralize with a mere glare. When you do, Demoralize loses the auditory trait and gains the visual trait, and you doesn’t take a penalty if the creature doesn’t understand your language.

    Quick-Tempered [free-action] Trigger You roll initiative; Requirements You are not encumbered or wearing heavy armor; Effect So long as you are able to move freely, your fury is instinctive and instantaneous. You Rage.

    Rage [one-action] (barbarian, concentrate, emotion, mental) Requirements You are not fatigued or raging; Effect You tap into your inner fury and begin raging. You gain 3 temporary hit points. Your Rage lasts for 1 minute, until you fall unconscious, or until the encounter ends, whichever comes first. You can’t voluntarily stop raging. When you stop raging, you lose any remaining temporary Hit Points from Rage, and can’t gain temporary Hit Points from using the Rage action again for 1 minute. While you are raging, you:
    • Deal 2 additional points of damage on melee Strikes (halved if your weapon or unarmed attack is agile; instead deal 6 additional damage with your Large bastard sword).
    • Can’t use actions that have the concentrate trait unless they also have the rage trait. You can Seek while raging.

    Raging Intimidation You can use the Demoralize action while raging and gain Intimidating Glare as an additional skill feat.

    Sudden Charge [two-actions] (flourish) You dash up to a foe and swing. Stride twice. If you end your movement within melee reach of at least one enemy, you can make a melee Strike against that enemy. You can use Sudden Charge while Burrowing, Climbing, Flying, or Swimming instead of Striding if you have the corresponding movement type. Because Sudden Charge has the flourish trait, you can only use Sudden Charge if you haven’t used an action with the flourish trait yet this turn.

    Survey Wildlife You can spend 10 minutes assessing the area around you to find out what creatures are nearby based on nests, scat, and marks on vegetation. Attempt a Survival check against a DC determined by the GM based on how obvious the signs are. On a success, you can attempt a Recall Knowledge check with a –2 penalty to learn more about the creatures just from these signs.

    Equipment:
    The following rules apply to Seelah’s equipment.
    Backpack A backpack can hold up to 4 Bulk worth of items. If you’re carrying or stowing the pack rather than wearing it on your back, its Bulk is light instead of negligible. The first 2 Bulk of items stowed in your backpack do not count against your Bulk limits (and are not included in your worn Bulk).

    Deadly (trait) On a critical hit, the weapon adds a weapon damage die of the listed size; this is added after doubling the weapon’s damage.

    □ Elixir of Life, Minor (alchemical, consumable, elixir, healing) Activate [one-action] (Interact); Effect Upon drinking this elixir, you regain 1d6 Hit Points and gain a +1 item bonus to saving throws against diseases and poisons for 10 minutes.

    Holy (trait) Strikes with this trait may have additional effects against unholy creatures.

    Repair Toolkit A repair kit is required to Repair items with the Crafting skill.

    Thieves’ Toolkit You need a thieves’ toolkit to Pick Locks or Disable Devices (of some types) using the Thievery skill. If your thieves’ toolkit is broken, you can repair it by replacing the lock picks with replacement picks appropriate to your toolkit; this doesn’t require using the Repair action. If you wear your thieves’ toolkit, you can draw and replace it as part of the action that uses it.

    Versatile (trait) A versatile weapon can be used to deal an alternate damage type listed. For instance, a slashing weapon that has “versatile P” can be used to deal piercing or slashing damage. Choose the damage type each time you make an attack.

    Shield Actions:
    While she has a shield equipped, Seelah can use the following actions.

    Raise Shield [one-action] While wielding a shield, you position it to protect yourself until the beginning of your next turn. This grants you a +2 circumstance bonus to AC, and you can use the Shield Block reaction.

    Shield Block [reaction] Trigger You would be damaged by a physical attack while your shield is raised; Effect You interpose your shield between yourself and the attack, reducing the damage by 5. You and your shield each take any remaining damage, possibly breaking or destroying the shield (the shield gains the broken condition after taking 10 or more damage and is destroyed once it’s taken 20 damage).

    Edicts and Anathema:
    As a paladin of Iomedae, you care deeply about the edicts and anathema you take from your deity, sanctification, and cause. These are a tool for roleplaying between you, the GM, and the other players at the table—you’re still playing a nuanced character, not strictly following a script.
    Acts fundamentally opposed to your deity’s ideals are anathema to your faith. Learning or casting spells, committing acts, and using items that are anathema to your deity remove you from your deity’s good graces. Similarly, using items, spells, or actions that are anathema to the tenets or goals of your faith could interfere with your connection to your deity.
    If you perform enough acts that are anathema to your deity, you lose the magical abilities that come from your connection to your deity. Seelah’s edicts and anathema are as follows:
    EDICTS
    • be temperate, fight for justice and honor, hold valor in your heart
    • do not knowingly harm innocents or fail to prevent harm to an innocent if your direct intervention could save them
    • follow the law, respect legitimate authorities or leadership
    ANATHEMA
    • abandon a companion in need, dishonor yourself, refuse a challenge from an equal
    • commit murder
    • take advantage of another, cheat

    Feats and Abilities
    Seelah’s feats and abilities are described below.

    Champion’s Aura You’re surrounded by an aura in a 15-foot emanation. It has the aura and divine traits. Any follower of your deity within the aura immediately knows you’re a champion of your deity. This aura is used as the range for your champion’s reaction and for various other effects. You can suppress or resume the aura as a single action, which has the concentrate trait, and it ends if you fall unconscious.

    Nimble Reprisal You can use a ranged weapon to make a ranged Strike instead of a melee Strike for Retributive Strike. The enemy needs to be in range, but not in reach, and it must still be in your champion’s aura.
    You can also make melee Strikes against enemies a bit farther away. If the enemy that triggered your reaction is outside your reach but is within 5 feet of your reach, as part of your reaction you can Step to put the enemy in your reach before making a melee Retributive Strike

    Pickpocket You can Steal or Palm an Object that’s closely guarded, such as in a pocket, without taking the –5 penalty (outright theft may violate your code, but using these abilities to thwart or trick the forces of evil is well within your purview). You can’t steal objects that would be extremely noticeable or time consuming to remove (such as a worn suit of armor).

    Retributive Strike [reaction] (divine) Trigger An enemy damages your ally, and both are in your champion’s aura; Effect You protect your ally and strike your enemy. The ally gains resistance 3 to all damage against the triggering damage. If the enemy is within reach, make a melee Strike against it.

    ⃞ Focus Points You gain a pool of Focus Points that allow you to cast your devotion spell: lay on hands. Each use of this spell uses 1 Focus Point and Seelah currently has a total focus pool of 1.

    Lay On Hands [one-action] (uncommon, champion, focus, healing, manipulate, vitality) Range touch; Targets 1 willing living creature or 1 undead creature; Effect You restore 6 Hit Points to a willing, living target; if the target is one of your allies, they also gain a +2 status bonus to AC for 1 round. Against an undead target, you deal 1d6 vitality damage with a basic Fortitude save (DC 17); if it fails, it also takes a –2 status penalty to AC for 1 round.

    Equipment:
    The following rules apply to Quinn’s equipment.
    Agile (trait) The multiple attack penalty you take on the second attack each round with this weapon is –4 instead of –5, and –8 instead of –10 on the third and any further attacks in the round.

    Backpack A backpack can hold up to 4 Bulk worth of items. If you’re carrying or stowing the pack rather than wearing it on your back, its Bulk is light instead of negligible. The first 2 Bulk of items stowed in your backpack do not count against your Bulk limits (and are not included in your worn Bulk).

    Concealable (trait) You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to Stealth checks and DCs to hide or conceal a weapon with this trait.

    Finesse (trait) You can use your Dexterity instead of Strength to calculate your attack bonus (but not damage rolls) with this melee weapon.

    ⃞⃞⃞⃞ Lesser Acid Flask (acid, alchemical, bomb, consumable, splash) Level 1; Usage held in 1 hand; Bulk L; Activate [one-action] (Strike); Effect This flask deals 1 acid damage, 1d6 persistent acid damage, and 1 acid splash damage.
    Splash (trait) If an attack with a splash weapon fails, succeeds, or critically succeeds, all creatures within 5 feet of the target (including the target) take the listed splash damage. On a failure (but not a critical failure), the target of  the attack still takes the splash damage. Add splash damage together with the initial damage against the target before applying the target’s weaknesses or resistances. You don’t multiply splash damage on a critical hit.

    Reload (trait) This weapon requires you to use 1 Interact action to reload before it can be fired again.

    Feats and Abilities:
    Quinn’s feats and abilities are described below.

    Cooperative Nature The short human life span lends perspective and has taught you from a young age to set aside differences and work with others to achieve greatness. You gain a +4 circumstance bonus to checks to Aid.

    Group Impression When you Make an Impression, you can compare your Diplomacy check result to the Will DCs of up to 10 targets you conversed with, with no penalty.

    Pursue a Lead (concentrate, exploration) You name one detail you’ve identified that you think is part of a larger mystery, then spend 1 minute examining it. The detail is typically either obvious or something you’ve already discovered using Recall Knowledge, Sense Motive, Gather Information, or a similar action. After the minute passes, the GM either confirms there’s a larger mystery or tells you there’s nothing more to learn (the detail is inconsequential or you know all the information already). If there is in fact a larger mystery at play, you can’t Pursue a Lead again for 10 minutes, but you can choose to open an investigation. To do so, define the question at the heart of the mystery, such as “Where has the priceless work of art that was supposed to hang here been taken?” or “Who or what killed this priest?”
    Investigation Bonus Whenever you attempt a Perception check or skill check to attempt to get closer to answering the question at the heart of an active investigation, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to the check. The exact checks this applies to depend on the actions you use to investigate and are determined by the GM, but checks to investigate are typically Perception checks or skill checks that use Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma.
    Active Investigations You can maintain two active investigations at a time. If you Pursue another Lead after that, the case must be different from any of your current investigations (as far as you are aware), and you give up on a current investigation of your choice. Once you’ve given up pursuit of an investigation, you can’t Pursue a Lead into it again until after the next time you make your daily preparations.
    Solving an Investigation If you answer the question at the heart of your investigation, the GM tells you that you’ve done so. You don’t lose the bonus or other benefits until you choose to close the investigation by Pursuing a Lead again or voluntarily Dismissing it. If what you discover points to an even larger mystery, you can work with the GM to adapt the question to the new information.

    Clue In [reaction] (concentrate) Frequency once per 10 minutes; Trigger Another creature attempts a check that could help get you closer to answering the question at the heart of one of your active investigations.; Effect You share information with the triggering creature. They gain a +1 circumstance bonus to their check. The GM can add any relevant traits to this reaction depending on the situation, such as auditory and linguistic if you’re conveying information verbally.

    Devise a Stratagem [one-action] or [free-action] (concentrate, fortune) Frequency once per round; Effect You assess a foe’s weaknesses in combat and use them to formulate a plan of attack against your enemy. Choose a creature you can see. You can Devise a Stratagem as a free action if you’re aware that creature could help answer the question at the heart of one of your active investigations. Roll a d20, then decide on an attack stratagem or skill stratagem.
    Attack Stratagem If you Strike the chosen creature before the start of your next turn, you must use the result of the d20 roll from Devise a Strategem for your Strike’s attack roll instead of rolling. You make this substitution only for the first Strike you make against the creature this round, not any subsequent ones. When you make this substitution, you can add your Intelligence modifier to your attack roll instead of your Strength or Dexterity modifier, provided you Strike with your sword cane, fist, crossbow or thrown bomb.
    Skill Stratagem You can’t attempt to Strike the target until the start of your next turn. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to your next Intelligence-, Wisdom-, or Charisma-based skill check or Perception check involving the target before the start of your next turn. If you would gain your Pursue a Lead investigation bonus to such a check, that bonus increases by 1 instead of you gaining the +1 bonus listed.

    Known Weaknesses Whenever you Devise a Stratagem, you can also attempt a check to Recall Knowledge as part of that action before rolling the d20. If you critically succeed at the Recall Knowledge check, you notice a weakness and can convey the information to allies to grant each of them a +1 circumstance bonus to their next attack roll against the subject, as long as their attack is made before the beginning of your next turn. If you choose an attack stratagem, this bonus applies to that attack roll too.

    Expeditious Inspection [free-action] Frequency once per 10 minutes; Effect You observe and assess your surroundings with great speed. You Recall Knowledge, Seek, or Sense Motive.

    That’s Odd When you enter a new location, the GM should give you a hint about any hidden passageways (such as scuff marks near a bookcase that’s actually a swinging door), creatures or hazards (such as drippage on the floor from an unseen fungus growing on the rafters), or valuables (such as bunched carpet over a secret compartment in the floor that contains a bag of coins) in the ;ocation. The GM doesn’t need to provide clues for rooms that have no significant secret or hidden features. If you wish, you can Pursue a Lead concerning this detail even if you have Pursed a Lead less than 10 minutes ago. You learn only that an area or object is suspicious, but not why it’s suspicious. That’s Odd doesn’t reveal whether creatures are suspicious. You don’t typically get any benefit when you leave and come back to a place, though if a major change has happened there and time has passed, the GM might determine that you do.

    Agile (trait) The multiple attack penalty you take on the second attack each round with this weapon is –4 instead of –5, and –8 instead of –10 on the third and any further attacks in the round.

    Backpack A backpack can hold up to 4 Bulk worth of items. If you’re carrying or stowing the pack rather than wearing it on your back, its Bulk is light instead of negligible. The first 2 Bulk of items stowed in your backpack do not count against your Bulk limits (and are not included in your worn Bulk).

    □□ Bottled Lightning, Lesser (alchemical, bomb, consumable, electricity, splash) Activate [one-action] (Strike); Effect A thrown bottled lightning deals 1d6 electricity damage and 1 electricity splash damage, and makes the target off-guard on a successful attack.

    □□ Elixir of Life, Minor (alchemical, consumable, elixir, healing) Activate [one-action] (manipulate); Effect Upon drinking this elixir, you regain 1d6 Hit Points and gain a +1 item bonus to saving throws against diseases and poisons for 10 minutes.

    Finesse (trait) You can choose to use Dexterity instead of Strength on attack rolls with this melee weapon.

    Grappling Hook You can throw a grappling hook with a rope tied to it to make a climb easier. To anchor a grappling hook, make a secret attack roll against a DC depending on the target (typically 20). On a success, your hook has a firm hold, but on a critical failure, the hook seems like it will hold but actually falls when you’re partway through the climb.

    Nonlethal (trait) Attacks with this weapon can be nonlethal and can be used to knock creatures unconscious instead of killing them.

    Splash (trait) If an attack with a splash weapon fails, succeeds, or critically succeeds, all creatures within 5 feet of the target (including the target) take the listed splash damage. On a failure (but not a critical failure), the target of the attack still takes the splash damage. Add splash damage together with the initial damage against the target before applying the target’s weaknesses or resistances. You don’t multiply splash damage on a critical hit.

    Thrown (trait) You can throw this weapon as a ranged attack. A thrown weapon adds your Strength modifier to damage just like a melee weapon does. When this trait appears on a melee weapon, it also includes the range increment in feet.

    Trip (trait) You can use this weapon to Trip with the Athletics skill even if you don’t have a free hand. If you critically fail a check to Trip using the weapon, you can drop the weapon to take the effect of a failure instead of a critical failure.

    Unarmed (trait) An unarmed attack uses a part of your body. It doesn’t take up a hand and can’t be Disarmed.

    Feats and Abilities:
    Sajan’s feats and abilities are described below.
    Cat Fall Your catlike acrobatics allow you to soften the impact of your falls. Treat falls as 10 feet shorter.

    Flurry of Blows [one-action] (flourish) Make two unarmed strikes. If both hit the same creature, combine their damage for the purpose of resistances and weaknesses. Apply your multiple attack penalty to the Strikes normally. Flurry of Blows has the flourish trait and can be used only once per turn.

    Powerful Fist Your training as a monk increases your unarmed attack damage to 1d6 and allows you to make lethal unarmed attacks without penalty.

    Tiger Stance [one-action] (stance) Requirements you are unarmored; Effect You enter the stance of a tiger and can make tiger claw attacks. These deal 1d8 slashing damage; are in the brawling group; and have the agile, finesse, nonlethal, and unarmed traits. On a critical success with your tiger claws, if you deal damage, the target takes 1d4 persistent bleed damage. As long as your Speed is at least 20 feet while in Tiger Stance, you can Step 10 feet. Once you enter tiger stance, it lasts until you are knocked out, until you put on armor, or until the encounter ends, whichever comes first.

    Weapon Proficiency (martial) You are trained with all martial weapons, including the temple sword.

    □ Focus Points You gain a pool of Focus Points that allow you to cast your qi spell: qi rush. Each use of this spell uses 1 Focus Point, and you currently have a total Focus Point pool of 1.

    Qi Rush [one-action] (uncommon, concentrate, divine, focus, monk) Accelerated by your qi, you move with such speed you become a blur. Move two times: two Strides, two Steps, or one Stride and one Step (in either order). You gain the concealed condition during this movement and until the start of your next turn

    Equipment:
    The following rules apply to Korakai’s equipment.
    Backpack A backpack can hold up to 4 Bulk worth of items. If you’re carrying or stowing the pack rather than wearing it on your back, its Bulk is light instead of negligible. The first 2 Bulk of items stowed in your backpack do not count against your Bulk limits (and are not included in your worn Bulk).

    □ Elixir of Life, Minor (alchemical, consumable, elixir, healing) Activate [one-action] (Interact); Effect Upon drinking this elixir, you regain 1d6 Hit Points and gain a +1 item bonus to saving throws against diseases and poisons for 10 minutes.

    Finesse (trait) You can use your Dexterity instead of Strength to calculate your attack bonus (but not damage rolls) with this melee weapon.

    Reload (trait) This weapon requires you to use 1 Interact action to reload before it can be fired again.

    □ Scroll of Runic Weapon When holding this scroll, you can cast runic weapon (see Spells on next page). After you Cast the Spell, the scroll is destroyed.

    Shove (trait) You can use this weapon to Shove with the Athletics skill even if you don’t have a free hand. This uses the weapon’s reach (if different from your own) and adds the weapon’s item bonus to attack rolls as an item bonus to the Athletics check. If you critically fail a check to Shove using the weapon, you can drop the weapon to take the effects of a failure instead of a critical failure.

    Two-Hand (trait) This weapon can be wielded with two hands. Doing so changes its weapon damage die to the indicated value.

    Versatile (trait) A versatile weapon can be used to deal an alternate damage type listed. For instance, a piercing weapon that has “versatile S” can be used to deal piercing or slashing damage. Choose the damage type each time you make an attack

    Feats and Abilities:
    Korakai’s feats and abilities are described below.
    Foretell Harm [free-action] (cursebound, divine) Frequency once per round; Requirements Your previous action was to Cast a non-cantrip Spell that dealt damage; Effect Your magic echoes ominously as you glimpse injury in the target’s future. At the beginning of your target’s next turn, it takes damage equal to twice the triggering spell’s rank as a seemingly random and minor misfortune finds it. The damage and type of misfortune is of a type matching the spell; for instance, if you dealt fire damage, a flame might spontaneous ignite on them or they might burn a hand on their torch. The target is then temporarily immune to Foretell Harm for 24 hours.

    Oracle Spellcasting Your connection to the powers of wind, rain, and lightning grants you the ability to wield divine magic. You can cast divine spells using the Cast a Spell activity. See the Spells section below for details on the spells you can cast. The tempest mystery also lets you cast electric arc as a divine spell.

    Low-Light Vision You can see in dim light as though it were bright light, and you ignore the concealed condition due to dim light.

    Oracle Spellcasting Your connection to the powers of wind, rain, and lightning grants you the ability to wield divine magic. You can cast divine spells using the Cast a Spell activity. See the Spells section below for details on the spells you can cast. The tempest mystery also lets you cast electric arc as a divine spell.

    Skyborn Tengu Your connection to the spirits of wind and sky mean you take no damage from falling, regardless of the distance you fall.

    Seasoned You’ve mastered the preparation of many types of food and drink. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to checks to Craft food and drink, including potions

    Revelation Spells and Curse:
    □ Revelation Spells Your oracular mystery grants you the tempest touch revelation spell, which you can cast by spending 1 Focus Point from your focus pool of 1. When you cast a revelation spell, it causes your oracular curse to progress (see Oracular Curse below).

    Tempest Touch [one-action] (uncommon, cold, cursebound, focus, manipulate, oracle, water) Range touch; Targets 1 creature; Defense Fortitude; Effect Your touch calls forth a churning mass of icy water that clings to your target, dealing 1d4 bludgeoning damage and 1d4 cold damage. The target must attempt a Fortitude save.
    Critical Success The target is unaffected.
    Success The target takes half damage and a –5-foot circumstance penalty to its Speeds until the end of your next turn.
    Failure The target takes full damage and a –10-foot circumstance penalty to its Speeds until the end of your next turn.
    Critical Failure As failure, but the target takes double damage.

    ORACULAR CURSE
    As an oracle, you can tap into the pure and unmitigated divine power of creation to supplement your spellcasting via cursebound abilities. These abilities grant you special benefits, but the backlash of letting this power into your mortal body manifests as an oracular curse. The more cursebound abilities you use, the more your curse worsens, but you might gain divine benefits even as it tightens its grip on your soul.
    Your oracular curse is expressed using the cursebound condition, a unique condition that affects only oracles. Immediately after the first time you use a cursebound ability, you become cursebound 1, and if you use a cursebound ability while you are already cursebound, you increase the value of your cursebound condition by 1 after the ability resolves. You can tolerate only a modest amount of divine power, and your cursebound condition can’t increase beyond cursebound 2. Once saturated in divine power, your soul can’t absorb any more, and so you can’t use a cursebound ability if you are already at your maximum cursebound condition.
    You remain cursebound until you Refocus, which reduces your cursebound condition by 1 in addition to restoring a Focus Point. As your curse is a direct result of divine power, you cannot mitigate, reduce, or remove the effects of your curse or any ability with the cursebound trait by any means other than Refocusing. For example, if a cursebound effect makes creatures concealed from you, you can’t negate that concealed condition through a magic item or spell, such as sure strike (though you would still benefit from the other effects of that item or spell). Likewise, cleanse affliction and similar abilities don’t affect your curse at all.

    Curse of Inclement Headwinds
    The weather seems to always oppose you in ways large and small. Even when you are calm and at rest, your hair and clothing are inconveniently blown about by gentle winds, you are slightly damp from the faintest drizzle, and your touch often comes with a static shock. When you have the cursebound condition, you are opposed by the elements, with the following effects.
    Cursebound 1 Lightning is drawn to you. You gain electricity weakness 2 and electricity spells or effects that have additional effects for a creature wearing or holding metal treat you as though you were wearing metal. Any immunity or resistance you have to such spells and effects is suppressed.
    Cursebound 2 Blowing winds impose a -2 circumstance penalty to ranged attack rolls you make.

    Spells:
    Korakai can cast the following spells. He can cast his 1st-rank spells three times per day in any combination, and he has an additional 1st- rank spell on a scroll.

    Cantrips
    Detect Magic [two-actions] (cantrip, concentrate, detection, manipulate) Area 30-foot emanation; Effect You send out a pulse that registers the presence of magic. You receive no information beyond the presence or absence of magic. You can choose to ignore magic you’re fully aware of, such as the magic items and ongoing spells of you and your allies. You detect illusion magic only if that magic’s effect has a lower rank than the rank of your detect magic spell, though items that have an illusion aura but aren’t deceptive in appearance (such as an invisibility potion) are typically detected normally.

    Electric Arc [two-actions] (cantrip, concentrate, electricity, manipulate) Range 30 feet; Targets 1 or 2 creatures; Defense basic Reflex; Effect An arc of lightning leaps from one target to another. Each target takes 2d4 electricity damage with a basic Reflex save.

    Guidance [one-action] (cantrip, concentrate) Range 30 feet; Targets 1 creature; Duration until the start of your next turn; Effect You ask for the guidance of supernatural entities, granting the target a +1 status bonus to one attack roll, Perception check, saving throw, or skill check the target attempts before the duration ends. The target chooses which roll to use the bonus on before rolling. If the target uses the bonus, the spell ends. Either way, the target is then temporarily immune for 1 hour.

    Light [two-actions] (cantrip, concentrate, light, manipulate) Range 120 feet; Duration until your next daily preparations; Effect You create an orb of light that sheds bright light in a 20-foot radius (and dim light for the next 20 feet) in a color you choose. If you create the light in the same space as a willing creature, you can attach the light to the creature, causing it to float near that creature as it moves. You can Sustain the spell to move the light up to 60 feet; you can attach or detach it from a creature as part of this movement.
    You can Dismiss the spell. If you Cast the Spell while you already have four light spells active, you must choose one of the existing spells to end.

    Shield [one-action] (cantrip, concentrate, force) Duration until the start of your next turn; Effect You raise a magical shield of force. This counts as using the Raise a Shield action (Player Core 419), giving you a +1 circumstance bonus to AC until the start of your next turn, but it doesn’t require a hand to use.
    While the spell is in effect, you can use the Shield Block reaction (page 262) with your magic shield. The shield has Hardness 5. You can use the spell’s reaction to reduce damage from any spell or magical effect, even if it doesn’t deal physical damage. After you use Shield Block, the spell ends and you can’t cast it again for 10 minutes.

    Shield Block [reaction] Trigger You would be damaged by a physical attack while your shield is conjured; Effect You interpose your magical  shield between yourself and the attack, reducing the damage by 5. You take any remaining damage.

    Vitality Lash [two-actions] (cantrip, concentrate, manipulate, vitality) Range 30 feet; Targets 1 creature that is undead or otherwise has void healing; Defense Fortitude; Effect You demolish the target’s corrupted essence with energy from Creation’s Forge. You deal 2d6 vitality damage with a basic Fortitude save. If the creature critically fails the save, it is also enfeebled 1 until the start of your next turn.

    1st
    Heal [one-action] to [three-actions] (healing, manipulate, vitality) Range varies; Targets 1 willing living creature or 1 undead creature; Effect You channel vital energy to heal the living or damage the undead. If the target is a willing living creature, you restore 1d8 Hit Points. If the target is undead, you deal that amount of vitality damage to it, and it gets a basic Fortitude save. The number of actions you spend when Casting this Spell determines its targets, range, area, and other parameters.
    \[one-action] The spell has a range of touch.
    \[two-actions] (concentrate): The spell has a range of 30 feet. If you’re healing a living creature, increase the Hit Points restored by 8.
    \[three-actions] (concentrate): You disperse vital energy in a 30-foot emanation, targeting all living and undead creatures in the area (this does not include the additional healing from the 2-action option).

    Fear [two-actions] (concentrate, emotion, fear, manipulate, mental) Range 30 feet; Targets 1 creature; Defense Will; Duration varies; Effect You plant fear in the target; it must attempt a Will save.
    Critical Success The target is unaffected.
    Success The target is frightened 1.
    Failure The target is frightened 2.
    Critical Failure The target is frightened 3 and fleeing for 1 round.
    □ Runic Weapon [two-actions] (concentrate, manipulate) Range touch; Targets 1 non-magical weapon that is unattended or wielded by a willing creature; Duration 1 minute; Effect The weapon glimmers with magic as temporary runes carve down its length. The target becomes a +1 striking weapon, gaining a +1 item bonus to attack rolls and increasing the number of weapon damage dice to two

    Thunderstrike [two-actions] (concentrate, electricity, manipulate, sonic) Range 120 feet; Targets 1 creature; Defense basic reflex; Effect You call down a tendril of lightning that cracks with thunder, dealing 1d12 electricity damage and 1d4 sonic damage to the target with a basic Reflex save. A target wearing metal armor or made of metal takes a –1 circumstance bonus to its save, and if damaged by the spell is clumsy 1 for 1 round.

    □ Antidote, Lesser (alchemical, consumable, elixir) Activate [one-action] (Interact) Effect Upon drinking this elixir, you gain a +2 item bonus on Fortitude saving throws against poison for 6 hours.

    Backpack A backpack can hold up to 4 Bulk worth of items. If you’re carrying or stowing the pack rather than wearing it on your back, its Bulk is light instead of negligible.

    Reload (trait) This weapon takes 1 Interact action to reload before it can be fired again.

    Two-Hand (trait) This weapon can be wielded with two hands. Doing so changes its weapon damage die to the indicated value

    Feats and Abilities:
    Seoni’s feats and abilities are described below.

    Adapted Cantrip You can cast forbidding ward as an arcane spell (included in Seoni’s cantrips).

    Assurance - Survival (fortune) Even in the worst circumstances, you can perform basic tasks with the Survival skill. You can forego rolling a skill check for your chosen skill to instead receive a total check result of 13 (do not apply any modifiers to this result).

    Bloodline (Imperial) Your bloodline defines the source of your magical power; for you this is your connection to ancient spellcasters who had mastered magic, and their power manifests in you.

    Blood Magic Whenever you cast ancestral memories, or force barrage using one of your spell slots, you gain your choice of a +1 status bonus to either AC or saving throws.

    Sorcerer Spellcasting You can cast arcane spells using the Cast a Spell activity. See the Spells section below for details on the spells you can cast.

    Sorcerous Potency When you Cast a Spell from your spell slots that either deals damage or restores Hit Points, you gain a status bonus to that spell’s damage or healing equal to the spell’s rank. This applies only to the initial damage or healing the spell deals when cast. An individual creature takes this damage or benefits from this healing only once per spell, even if the spell would damage or heal that creature multiple times. This bonus has already been noted on Seoni’s 1st-rank spells.

    ⃞ Focus Points You gain a pool of Focus Points that allow you to cast your bloodline spell: ancestral memories. Each use of this spell uses 1 Focus Point and you currently have a total focus pool of 1.

    Ancestral Memories [one-action] (uncommon, concentrate, focus, sorcerer) The memories of long-dead spellcasters grant you their knowledge, making your spells more formidable. You gain either a +1 status bonus to the next spell attack roll you attempt before the end of your turn or an enemy within 60 feet takes a –1 status penalty to the next saving throw they attempt against a spell you cast before the end of your turn.

    Spells:
    Seoni can cast the following spells. She can cast her 1st-rank spells three times per day in any combination.


    CANTRIPS
    Caustic Blast [two-actions] (acid, cantrip, concentrate, manipulate) Range 30 feet; Area 5-foot burst; Defense basic Reflex; Effect You fling a large glob of acid that immediately detonates, spraying nearby creatures. Creatures in the area take 1d8 acid damage with a basic Reflex save; on a critical failure, the creature also takes 1 persistent acid damage.

    Detect Magic [two-actions] (cantrip, detection, manipulate) Area 30-foot emanation; Effect You send out a pulse that registers the presence of magic. You receive no information beyond the presence or absence of magic. You can choose to ignore magic you’re fully aware of, such as the magic items and ongoing spells of you and your allies. You detect illusion magic only if that magic’s effect has a lower rank than the rank of your detect magic spell, though items that have an illusion aura but aren’t deceptive in appearance (such as an invisibility potion) are typically detected normally.

    Forbidding Ward [two-actions] (cantrip, concentrate, manipulate) Range 30 feet; Targets 1 ally and 1 enemy; Duration sustained up to 1 minute; Effect You ward an ally against the attacks and hostile spells from the target enemy. The target ally gains a +1 status bonus to Armor Class and saving throws against the target enemy’s attacks, spells, and other effects.

    Frostbite [two-actions] (cantrip, cold, concentrate, manipulate) Range 60 feet; Targets 1 creature; Defense Fortitude; Effect An orb of biting cold coalesces around your target, freezing its body. The target takes 2d4 cold damage with a basic Fortitude save. On a critical failure, the target also gains weakness 1 to bludgeoning until the start of your next turn.

    Shield [one-action] (cantrip, concentrate, force) Duration until the start of your next turn; Effect You raise a magical shield of force. This counts as using the Raise a Shield action (Player Core 419), giving you a +1 circumstance bonus to AC until the start of your next turn, but it doesn’t require a hand to use.
    While the spell is in effect, you can use the Shield Block reaction (page 262) with your magic shield. The shield has Hardness 5. You can use the spell’s reaction to reduce damage from any spell or magical effect, even if it doesn’t deal physical damage. After you use Shield Block, the spell ends and you can’t cast it again for 10 minutes.
    Shield Block [reaction] Trigger You would be damaged by a physical attack while your shield is conjured. Effect You interpose your magical shield between you and the attack, reducing the damage by 5. You take any remaining damage.

    1ST
    Dizzying Colors [two-actions] (concentrate, illusion, incapacitation, manipulate, visual) Area 15-foot cone; Defense Will; Duration 1 or more rounds; Effect You unleash a swirling multitude of colors that overwhelms creatures based on their Will saves.
    Critical Success The creature is unaffected.
    Success The creature is dazzled for 1 round.
    Failure The creature is stunned 1, blinded for 1 round, and dazzled for 1 minute.
    Critical Failure The creature is stunned for 1 round and blinded for 1 minute.

    Force Barrage [one-action] to [three-actions] (concentrate, force, manipulate) Range 120 feet; Targets 1 creature; Effect You fire a shard of solidified magic toward a creature that you can see. It automatically hits and deals 1d4+2 force damage. For each additional action you use when Casting the Spell, increase the number of shards you shoot by one, to a maximum of three shards for 3 actions. You choose the target for each shard individually. If you shoot more than one shard at the same target, combine the damage before applying bonuses or penalties to damage, resistances, weaknesses, and so forth.
    Grim Tendrils [two-actions] (concentrate, manipulate, void) Area 30 foot line; Defense Fortitude; Effect You unleash a wave of dark tendrils, dealing 2d4+1 void damage and 1 persistent bleed damage to living creatures in the line. Each living creature in the line must attempt a Fortitude save.
    Critical Success The creature is unaffected.
    Success The creature takes half the void damage and no persistent bleed damage.
    Failure The creature takes full damage.
    Critical Failure The creature takes double void damage and double persistent bleed damage.

    Backpack A backpack can hold up to 4 Bulk worth of items. If you’re carrying or stowing the pack rather than wearing it on your back, its Bulk is light instead of negligible. The first 2 Bulk of items stowed in your backpack don’t count against your Bulk limits (and are not included in your worn Bulk).

    Buckler You can Raise a Shield with your buckler as long as you have that hand free or are holding a light object that's not a weapon in that hand.

    Deadly (trait) On a critical hit, the weapon adds a weapon damage die of the listed size; this is added after doubling the weapon’s damage.

    Disarm (trait) You can use this weapon to Disarm with the Athletics skill even if you don’t have a free hand. This uses the weapon’s reach (if different from your own) and adds the weapon’s item bonus to attack rolls (if any) as an item bonus to the Athletics check. If you critically fail a check to Disarm using the weapon, you can drop the weapon to take the effects of a failure instead of a critical failure. On a critical success, you still need a free hand if you want to take the item.

    Finesse (trait) You can use your Dexterity instead of Strength to calculate your attack bonus (but not damage rolls) with this melee weapon.

    □ Healing Potion, Minor (consumable, healing, magical, vitality): Upon drinking this potion, you regain 1d8 Hit Points.

    Parry (trait) This weapon can be used defensively to block attacks. While wielding this weapon, if your proficiency with it is trained or better, you can spend an Interact action to position your weapon defensively, gaining a +1 circumstance bonus to AC until the start of your next turn.

    Thieves’ Toolkit You need a thieves’ toolkit to Pick Locks or Disable Devices (of some types) using the Thievery skill. If your thieves’ toolkit is broken, you can repair it by replacing the lock picks with replacement picks appropriate to your toolkit; this doesn’t require using the Repair action. If you wear your thieves’ toolkit, you can draw and replace it as part of the action that uses it.

    Thrown (trait) You can throw this weapon as a ranged attack. A thrown weapon adds your Strength modifier to damage just like a melee weapon does. When this trait appears on a melee weapon, it also includes the range increment in feet.

    Versatile (trait) A versatile weapon can be used to deal an alternatedamage type listed. For instance, a piercing weapon that has “versatile S” can be used to deal piercing or slashing damage. Choose the damage type each time you make an attack.

    Off-Hand Actions:
    Jirelle can wield another weapon, her dueling cape, or her buckler in her off hand, though she can wield only one of these three options at a time.

    Dueling Cape You can pull a dueling cape you’re wearing from your shoulder and wrap it around your arm with an Interact action. While wielding the dueling cape this way, the cape uses that arm and hand, and you can’t hold anything else in that hand. While you do so, you can spend an action to hold it in a protective position, giving you a +1 circumstance bonus to AC and to Deception checks to Feint until the start of your next turn.

    Raise Shield [one-action] While wielding a shield, you position it to protect yourself until the beginning of your next turn. This grants you a +1 circumstance bonus to AC, and you can use the Shield Block reaction.

    Feats and Abilities:
    Jirelle’s feats and abilities are described below.

    Panache You can enter a state of flair, called panache, by performing stylish actions in combat. As a swashbuckler with the fencer style,you gain panache by performing actions that have the bravado trait. Create a Diversion, Feint and Tumble Through gain the bravado trait when you use them. The GM might determine that a check to perform a particularly daring action, such as swinging on a chandelier or sliding down a drapery, can gain the bravado trait. These checks typically involve at least a single action and a non- trivial DC. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to skill checks with the bravado trait while in a combat encounter. While you have panache, you gain a +5-foot status bonus to your Speeds. You can use powerful finisher actions while you have panache; after using one, you lose your panache.

    Finisher (trait) Finishers are spectacular finishing moves. You can use a finisher only if you have panache, and you lose your panache immediately after performing a finisher. Once you use a finisher, you can’t use actions that have the attack trait for the rest of your turn. Some finisher actions also grant an effect on a failure. If your finisher succeeds, you can choose to apply the failure effect instead.

    Precise Strike You strike with flair. When you make a melee Strike with any of your listed weapons, you deal 2 additional precision damage. If the strike is part of a finisher, the additional damage is 2d6 precision damage instead.

    Confident Finisher [one-action] (finisher, swashbuckler) You make a graceful attack, piercing your foe’s defenses. Make a Strike with the following failure effect.
    Failure You deal half your precise strike damage to the target. This damage type is that of the weapon or unarmed attack you used for the Strike.

    Create a Diversion [one-action] (bravado, mental) With a gesture, a trick, or some distracting words, you can create a diversion that draws creatures’ attention elsewhere. If you use a gesture or trick, this action gains the manipulate trait. If you use distracting words, it gains the auditory and linguistic traits.
    Attempt a single Deception check and compare it to the Perception DCs of the creatures whose attention you’re trying to divert. Whether or not you succeed, creatures you attempt to divert gain a +4 circumstance bonus to their Perception DCs against your attempts to Create a Diversion for 1 minute.
    Success You become hidden to each creature whose Perception DC is less than or equal to your result. (The hidden condition allows you to Sneak away.) This lasts until the end of your turn or until you do anything except Step or use the Stealth skill to Hide or Sneak. If you Strike a creature, the creature remains off-guard against that attack, and you then become observed. If you do anything else, you become observed just before you act unless the GM determines otherwise.
    Failure You don’t divert the attention of any creatures whose Perception DC exceeds your result, and those creatures are aware. you were trying to trick them.

    Feint [one-action] (bravado, mental); Requirements You are within melee reach of the opponent you attempt to Feint; Effect With a misleading flourish, you leave an opponent unprepared for your real attack. Attempt a Deception check against that opponent’s Perception DC.
    Critical Success You throw your enemy’s defenses against you entirely off. The target is off-guard against melee attacks that you attempt against it until the end of your next turn.
    Success Your foe is fooled only momentarily. The target is off-guard against the next melee attack that you attempt against it before the end of your current turn.
    Critical Failure Your feint backfires. You are off-guard against melee attacks the target attempts against you until the end of your next turn.

    Goading Feint When you trick a foe, you can goad them into overextending their next attack. On a Feint, you can use the following success and critical success effects instead of any other effects you would gain when you Feint; if you do, other abilities that adjust the normal effects of your Feint no longer apply. You can choose whether to use the Goading Feint benefits or the normal benefits.
    Critical Success The target takes a –2 circumstance penalty to all attack rolls against you before the end of its next turn.
    Success The target takes a –2 circumstance penalty to its next attack roll against you before the end of its next turn

    Tumble Through [one-action] (bravado, move) You Stride up to your Speed. During this movement, you can try to move through the space of one enemy. Attempt an Acrobatics check against the enemy’s Reflex DC as soon as you try to enter its space. You can Tumble Through using Climb, Fly, Swim, or another action instead of Stride in the appropriate environment.
    Success You move through the enemy’s space, treating the squares in its space as difficult terrain (every 5 feet costs 10 feet of movement). If you don’t have enough Speed to move all the way through its space, you get the same effect as a failure.
    Failure Your movement ends, and you trigger reactions as if you had moved out of the square you started in.

    Low-Light Vision You can see in dim light as though it were bright light, and you ignore the concealed condition due to dim light.

    Underwater Marauder You’ve learned to fight underwater. You are not off-guard while in water, and you don’t take the usual penalties for using a bludgeoning or slashing melee weapon in water.

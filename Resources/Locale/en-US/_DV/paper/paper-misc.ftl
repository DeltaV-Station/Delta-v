paper-salvage-gun-safe-notice = SALVAGE SPECIALIST SELF DEFENSE ARMAMENT NOTICE

      Greetings, salvage specialist!

      With the growing concern for the safety of our brave salvage workers, we have deployed a standard-issue gun safe.

      Responsible handing of these firearms is expected. Any use that does not fall under work-related self-defense is strictly prohibited and may result in the removal of firearm privileges and/or termination from the salvage specialist team.

      Misuse of firearms resulting in endangerment of the station and/or threat or harm to another employee will be prosecuted by the station's justice department.

      Remember, safety and responsible firearm use in your hands!

      Nanotrasen Corporate Salvage Division

paper-security-superweapon-removed = Due to recent budget cuts in your sector, we are currently unable to supply your station with a "superweapon".

      We trust this will not be an issue.

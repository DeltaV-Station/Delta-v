paper-salvage-gun-safe-notice = SALVAGE SPECIALIST SELF DEFENSE ARMAMENT NOTICE

      Greetings, salvage specialist!

      With the growing concern for the safety of our brave salvage workers, we have deployed a standard-issue gun safe.

      Responsible handing of these firearms is expected. Any use that does not fall under work-related self-defense is strictly prohibited and may result in the removal of firearm privileges and/or termination from the salvage specialist team.

      Misuse of firearms resulting in endangerment of the station and/or threat or harm to another employee will be prosecuted by the station's justice department.

      Remember, safety and responsible firearm use in your hands!

      Nanotrasen Corporate Salvage Division

      Thank you for purchasing our viral carepackage!
      Due to a recent employee-satisfaction survey organized by our [color=darkblue][bold]Sophont Resources Department[/bold][/color], [color=darkblue][bold]Nanotrasen™[/bold][/color] offers you a quick and easy way to relieve the station from an ongoing [color=purple][bold]viral outbreak[/bold][/color], if the station's [color=#5b97bc][bold]medical facilities[/bold][/color] are failing.

      ​[head=2][color=#134975]How to mix Ambuzol:[/color][/head]
      ​[bullet] Pour [bold]15u Hydrogen[/bold] and [bold]5u Nitrogen[/bold] into a bottle to mix [color=#77b58e][bold]Ammonia[/bold][/color].
      ​[bullet] Pour [bold]5u Silicon[/bold], [bold]5u Potassium[/bold] and [bold]5u Nitrogen[/bold] into a different bottle to mix [color=#3a1d8a][bold]Dylovene[/bold][/color].
      ​[bullet] Mix [bold][color=#77b58e]5u Ammonia[/color][/bold] and [bold][color=#3a1d8a]5u Dylovene[/color][/bold] with [bold][color=#2b0700]10u Zombie Blood[/color][/bold] to synthesize [bold][color=#86caf7]40u Ambuzol[/color][/bold].

      ​[head=2][color=#134975]How to use Ambuzol:[/color][/head]
      It is [bold]imperative[/bold] to [bold]not drink[/bold] it! Neither use Hyposprays!
      The care package contains sterile syringes, use them.
      Fill a syringe up with [bold][color=#86caf7]10u Ambuzol[/color][/bold] and administer the whole dosage to the infected patient.
      The supplied [bold][color=green]BioSuits[/color][/bold] will help prevent catching the infection when dealing with the patients.
      ​[color=#134975]──────────────────────────────────────────[/color]
      ​[color=gray][italic]Due to a recent lawsuit for insufficent healthcare precautions for work-hazards, this qualifies as the bare minimum to comply with current Employee Rights for a safe work-environment.
      ​[color=darkblue][bolditalic]Nanotrasen™[/bolditalic][/color] is unable to supply stations with [bolditalic][color=#86caf7]Ambuzol[/color][/bolditalic], as every viral infection requires the specific virus strain to synthesize the cure.
      ​[color=darkblue][bolditalic]Nanotrasen™[/bolditalic][/color] is not liable to any damages caused by improper usage or administration of chemicals.
      This instructions pamphlet will be used as "Exhibit A" if you sue [color=darkblue][bolditalic]Nanotrasen™[/bolditalic][/color].

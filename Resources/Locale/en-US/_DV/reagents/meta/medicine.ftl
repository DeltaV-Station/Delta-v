reagent-name-hemoxadone = hemoxadone
reagent-desc-hemoxadone = A cryogenics chemical. Used to treat severe blood loss by regenerating red blood cells and promoting reperfusion. Works regardless of the patient being alive or dead.

reagent-name-cyanoxadone = cyanoxadone
reagent-desc-cyanoxadone = A cryogenics chemical. Used to treat severe blood loss in blue-blooded creatures by regenerating hemocyanin and promoting reperfusion. Works regardless of the patient being alive or dead.

reagent-name-netinadone = netinadone
reagent-desc-netinadone = A cryogenic drug that slowly encourages rotting matter and brain tissue to regenerate.

reagent-name-anodynafil = anodynafil
reagent-desc-anodynafil = An effective short-lasting anesthetic that doesn't interfere with consciousness. It needs to be mixed with the patient's blood in order to work.

reagent-name-anodynafil-copper-blood = anodynafil (copper blood)
reagent-desc-anodynafil-copper-blood = Anodynafil mixed with blood to anesthetize a copper-blooded individual.

reagent-name-anodynafil-ammonia-blood = anodynafil (ammonia blood)
reagent-desc-anodynafil-ammonia-blood = Anodynafil mixed with blood to anesthetize an ammonia-blooded individual.

reagent-name-anodynafil-ammonia-blood = anodynafil (synth blood)
reagent-desc-anodynafil-ammonia-blood = Anodynafil mixed with blood to anesthetize a synthetic-blooded individual.

reagent-desc-doxarubixadone-deltav = A cryogenics chemical. Heals certain types of cellular damage caused by dangerous gases and chemicals. Works regardless of the patient being alive or dead.

reagent-desc-doxarubixadone-deltav = A cryogenics chemical. Heals certain types of cellular damage caused by dangerous gases and chemicals. Works regardless of the patient being alive or dead.

reagent-name-netinadone = netinadone
reagent-desc-netinadone = A cryogenic drug that slowly encourages rotting matter and brain tissue to regenerate.

reagent-name-umbroxol = umbroxol
reagent-desc-umbroxol = An ominous chemical. Used to treat holy damage from those weak to the veil. Overdoses may leave patients feeling cold.

reagent-name-unholy-water = unholy water
reagent-desc-unholy-water = Water treated with blood and sulfur. Just looking at it chills you to the bone.

reagent-name-anodynafil = anodynafil
reagent-desc-anodynafil = An effective short-lasting anesthetic that doesn't interfere with consciousness, but results in prolonged pain suppression.

reagent-name-trinoxadone = trinoxadone
reagent-desc-trinoxadone = A complex cryogenics chemical. Treats most damage types in alive and critical patients at a slower metabolism rate, however, only offers limited tissue regeneration in dead patients.

reagent-desc-dexalin-deltav = Used for treating minor oxygen deprivation and bloodloss. A required reagent for salbutamol and convermol.

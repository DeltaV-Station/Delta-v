reagent-name-vicodilicaine = Vicodilicaine
reagent-desc-vicodilicaine = Used to treat moderate to severe pain to the head. Most of the time is taken by mouth. Recreational use is common due to its hallucinogen properties. Discouraged to pair with other strong painkillers, antidepressants, and anxiety medication, though totally safe with alcohol.

reagent-name-libital = libital
reagent-desc-libital = A common but weak medicine used to heal brute trauma. Usually paired with other chemicals.

reagent-name-probital = probital
reagent-desc-probital = A common analgesic that is effective at treating general brute trauma, at the cost of slowing you down.

reagent-name-salicylicacid = salicylic acid
reagent-desc-salicylicacid = A heavy-duty analgesic that stabilizes the severely beaten, but is barely effective on people with less wounds. However, overdosing will reverse the effect.

reagent-name-aiuri = aiuri
reagent-desc-aiuri = A common, but weak medicine used to heal brute injuries. Usually paired with other chemicals.

reagent-name-lenturi = lenturi
reagent-desc-lenturi = A common chemical that is effective at treating burn damage by using the water inside your body.

reagent-name-oxandrolone = oxandrolone
reagent-desc-oxandrolone = A heavy-duty chemical that stabilizes the severely burned, but is barely effective on people with less wounds. However, overdosing will reverse the effect.

reagent-name-salbutamol = salbutamol
reagent-desc-salbutamol = A heavy-duty chemical that stabilizes the suffocated and reverses the effect of bloodloss, but is ineffective on people with less wounds. However, overdosing will reverse the effect.

reagent-name-convermol = convermol
reagent-desc-convermol = A fast-acting asphyxiation medicine that has the side effect of putting heavy strain on the body, dose carefully.

reagent-name-multiver = multiver
reagent-desc-multiver = A common antitoxin used to treat poison.

reagent-name-penteticacid = pentetic acid
reagent-desc-penteticacid = A complicated anti-toxin solution that quickly flushes out toxins and heals the damage left behind. Overdose causes extreme pain.

reagent-name-granibitulari = granibitulari
reagent-desc-granibitulari = A common, slow-acting medicine for all types of injuries.

reagent-name-hypothium = hypothium
reagent-desc-hypothium = A difficult to synthesize drug used to cure most wounds and clot blood.

reagent-name-pyroxadone = pyroxadone
reagent-desc-pyroxadone = A chemical that works inversely of cryoxadone, requiring high temperatures in order to work. Heals most damage.

reagent-name-ardthyrnkole = ardthyrnkole
reagent-desc-ardthyrnkole = A pyrogenics chemical used to treat severe frostbite on corpses by rapidly defrosting and regenerating frozen tissue.

reagent-name-natusixadone = natusixadone
reagent-desc-natusixadone = A pyrogenics chemical that burns away cancerous cells, regardless of if they are alive or dead.

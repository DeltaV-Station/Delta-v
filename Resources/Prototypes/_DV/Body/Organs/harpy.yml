    # DeltaV - All lungs should process all gas types on every update. Players are not likely to abuse poison stacking with gases.
    # On the other hand, limiting the reagent count causes the Metabolic Roll Asphyxiation bug: 
    # Oxygen is occasionally randomly excluded from being processed when many gas types are present

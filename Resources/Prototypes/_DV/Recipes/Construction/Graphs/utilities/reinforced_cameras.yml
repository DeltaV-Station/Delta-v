    # Extra nodes for eatch camera network type
    # This is because if you do not add them and removed the panel it would revert to (ReinforcedSurveillanceCameraConstructed)
    # Which in turn would remove that camera from that subnet and reclose the wire panel makeing you have to restart
    # extra note this is all beacause (wirepanelsecurity) was added if you wish to add (wirepanelsecurity) to normal cams good luck

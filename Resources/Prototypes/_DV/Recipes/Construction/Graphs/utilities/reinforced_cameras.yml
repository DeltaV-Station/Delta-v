    #base note from cams

    # once a camera is constructed, it will
    # instead just require wire cutting + welding
    # to immediately deconstruct

    #base note from cams

    # The extra nodes for eatch cam network type
    # is because if i did not add them and you removed the panel it would revert to (ReinforcedSurveillanceCameraConstructed)
    # witch in turn would remove that cam from that subnet and reclose the wire panel
    # extra note this is all beacause of the (wirepanelsecurity) was added if you want to add wirepanelsecurity to normal cams good luck

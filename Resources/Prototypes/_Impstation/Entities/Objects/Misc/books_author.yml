  name: ancient treatise on cosmology
  description: The book is an ancient synthleather-bound treatise with a bright, star-shaped mark on the cover. Though the pages seem to be dyed in odd hues, the ink appears clearly legible despite the book's apparent age. It's strangely well-preserved, and has clearly been stored away for a very long time.

# DELTA-V
# Due to the custom trait system, all traits have been moved under \Resources\Prototypes\_DV\Traits
# If you want to add a new one, do it there

## If you add a new trait, make sure to add the corresponding component to the whitelist in \Resources\Prototypes\Entities\Mobs\Player\clone.yml so it gets copied to clones correctly!

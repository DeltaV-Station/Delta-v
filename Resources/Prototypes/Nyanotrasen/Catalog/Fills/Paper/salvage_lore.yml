      Session 1: They should have just learned what's going on with the world and the Giant Space Fly.
      Session 2: They should know to ask the Wizard's Court about seismic distortions.
      Session 3: On their way to underground lair.
      Session 4: Just ran into the Architect Of Flies.
      Oh dear goodness they just started randomly killing everybody

The Python add-on Ruamel is needed for this.

Run 'pip install ruamel.yaml' in Windows Command Prompt

If you need to update pip use cmnd 'py -m ensurepip --upgrade'

To run the tidy tool:

Open Windows command prompt
Navigate to the DeltaV repository folder using 'cd' command
Run 'python Tools/DeltaV/tidy_map.py --infile Resources/Maps/MAPNAME.yml'
Note: if you want to clean a map that's still wip you can use 'python Tools/DeltaV/tidy_map.py --infile bin/Content.Server/data/MAPNAME.yml'

After you have a 'MAPNAME_tidy.yml' you can delete the old(dirty) one and remove the '_tidy' from the filename.

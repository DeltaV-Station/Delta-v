Delta-V is a fork of [Space Station 14](https://github.com/space-wizards/space-station-14), embracing a mixture of classic SS13 chaos and experimentation only possible with the new engine.

Space Station 14 is a remake of SS13 that runs on [Robust Toolbox](https://github.com/space-wizards/RobustToolbox), a homegrown engine written in C#.

### Delta-V is a continuation of the [Nyanotrasen](https://www.nyanotrasen.moe/) fork. Any work done in a non-base namespace may contain incorrect attributes due to rewrites and recommitting.

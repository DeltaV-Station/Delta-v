Space Law is a broad set of rules and regulations, collected and regulated by TerraGov, enacted and enforced by NanoTrasen and its [[Security Officer|Station Security]], with the oversight of [[Administrators#What_Do_Admins_Do?|CentCom]] - and, on occasion, TerraGov's Galactic Police Force. Space Law applies to all ranks and positions on stations under its jurisdiction, from the lowliest [[Passenger]] to the highest [[Captain]]; all are equal under the eyes of the Law, and all must ultimately answer to it.

It is highly recommended to read the '''[[Standard Operating Procedure|Standard Operating Procedures]]'''. Summaries of several pertinent sections are listed below.

* '''[[Standard Operating Procedure#Controlled Items|Controlled Items]]:''' If a member of station crew requires access to a Controlled Item for use in their job, or for regular function, they must obtain the signed and stamped approval of a relevant member of Station Command or the CO.  The latter is able to override the decisions of Station Command in this regard, however.
* '''[[Standard Operating Procedure#Sophonts and Synthetics|Sophonts & Synthetics]]:''' Sophonts are entities are able to utilize a structured language, communicate through the use of written, verbal, and/or body language (or by other means), and possess reasoning and introspection. Sophonts are legal persons, able to press charges under Space Law, and can be victims of certain crimes that specify sophont status. An entity's status as a sophont may be challenged during legal proceedings; the Defense and/or Prosecution must present evidence arguing that it meets, or does not meet, the criteria established above. The Judge will then arbitrate on the entity's status. Any synthetic, sillicon, or nonorganic entity with non-sophont status is to be considered a Synthetic. Synthetics are the property of the entity that constructs or employs them, unless otherwise stated. Damage or destruction of such Synthetics is considered vandalism of the entity's property.
* '''[[Standard Operating Procedure#Security Jurisdiction|Security Jurisdiction]]:''' Station law enforcement officers are bound by Space Law; they cannot operate outside of standard accessible areas, or perform searches, unless such action is allowed by either Alert Procedure or a valid warrant.
* '''[[Standard Operating Procedure#Detainment and Arrest|Detainment & Arrest]]:''' Members of law enforcement may detain sophonts under '''[[Standard Operating Procedure#Probable Cause|Probable Cause]]''' of criminal activity. These detainees must be informed of the crime they are suspected of committing, and may be moved to a secure location and/or restrained while law enforcement determine if a crime was committed. Such detention should last no longer than five minutes. Any sophont may be arrested, during which they are restrained, informed of their charges, and taken to the brig for search and processing under '''[[Standard Operating Procedure#Brig Procedure|Brig Procedure]]'''.
* '''[[Standard Operating Procedure#Sentencing|Sentencing]]:''' Any member of law enforcement is allowed to pass sentence on Misdemeanor, Felony, and Grand Felony charges. The Prosecutor is allowed to adjust such sentences, within reason.
* '''[[Standard Operating Procedure#Treatment of Prisoners|Treatment of Prisoners]]:''' Prisoners must be provided with food, water, clothing, free movement within the brig, adequate medical care, access to the Common and Prison radio channels, and moral, spiritual, or legal counseling if requested and available. If the brig becomes uninhabitable, prisoners must be securely and safely relocated to another area until the brig is functional once more. Prisoners sentenced to Extended Confinement have additional rights and firmer restrictions that must be upheld by law enforcement officials.
* '''[[Standard Operating Procedure#Paroles and Pardons|Paroles & Pardons]]:''' Parole may be offered under the discretion of the Warden, Head of Security, or CO. A parole hearing requires only a Judge, as discussed within Trial Procedure. Pardons may be issued by the arresting officer, the Judge of a trial, by the Warden (to those within the permanent brig), or by the CO, when deemed in the best interest of the crew or vessel, or when the circumstances of the crime warrant suspension of sentence.
* '''[[Standard Operating Procedure#Pressing Charges|Pressing Charges]]:''' Any sophont may press charges against any other sophont. Individuals may only be charged with a crime if it can be proveny beyond reasonable doubt that they have committed the crime.
* '''[[Standard Operating Procedure#Trial Procedure|Trial Procedure]]:''' A criminal trial’s Judge must be, in sequential order: The Chief Justice, the Court Clerk, an impartial member of Justice or Station Command, or the Warden. The Prosecution should ideally be the Prosecutor, or an available member of Station Command or Station Security in that order. The Defense should ideally be a member of the Justice department assigned to the defendant, though they are allowed to represent themselves if they wish. If insufficient crew are available, the Judge is fully authorized and strongly encouraged to pass a sentence of Extended Confinement until a proper trial can be held.
* '''[[Alert Procedure]]:''' Codes Blue, Red, Gamma, and Delta suspend the right to individual privacy, allowing warrantless search. The latter three codes allow for departmental raids, and the latter two place the station in martial law. These codes also authorize Security to carry progressively more advanced firearms, and loosen '''[[Standard Operating Procedure#Rules of Engagement|Rules of Engagement]]''' regarding their use.

=== Crime Codes Quick Reference ===
Use this to quickly find the Crime Code Numbers.

Crime codes are organized into four Category Codes (_XX) as listed below, with the most severe crimes being given the highest Severity Codes (x__). The sentencing officer or Judge should use discretion, and not charge an entity with two similar crimes for a singular offense.

For example, an attack upon a sophont which causes them to die of their injuries is Murder, not Assault AND Murder. Likewise, an entity should not be charged for both Possession AND Grand Possession on a singular Controlled Item held without proper authorization.

== Sentences ==
=== Capital ===
Capital Sentences are organized in order of severity, with the least severe last. Execution should be utilized as an '''absolute last resort,'''  for criminals whose crimes are extraordinarily cruel, or who prove impossible to confine through less restrictive means.

* '''Execution:''' Termination of the convict's life.
** Whenever any execution is performed, for any reason, a general announcement must be made stating who was executed, and for what reason.
** The convict may either face execution by firing squad, by lethal electrocution, by being ejected from the station via an airlock (being "spaced"), or by a method of their choosing, at the Judge's sole discretion.
** If recoverable, their remains must either be cremated, processed via the biomass reclaimer, or stored in the morgue.
* '''Decorporealization:''' Stripping the convict's mind from their body into a more restrictive form, such as a cyborg or soul gem.
* '''Preservative Stasis:''' Relocation of the convict into a morgue or similar controlled and regulated environment until one's sentence is concluded, or until the legal system can accomodate the convict.
* '''Exfiltration:''' Immediate retrieval of the convict via a CentComm or GALPOL prison transport.
** The prisoner may be held within the permanent brig until the transport arrives.
** If transport cannot be arranged, default to other capital sentences.
* '''Extended Confinement:''' Placing the convict into the Permanent Brig until the end of the shift, where they are to be transported to Central Command for processing.
** The convict has the same rights as any other prisoner within the Permanent Brig, whether they arrived by transport or were sentenced to Extended Confinement.

This page covers the standardized guidelines and procedures aboard the station, but are not written in law; be aware that in cases of dire emergency the commanding officer or certain individuals are authorized to temporarily alter current SOP as they see fit, at the risk of criminal penalties in the case of misuse or abuse! Make sure to look at [[Alert Procedure]] for guidelines that change based on the current alert level.
=General Regulations=

== '''Definitions''' ==
The terms specified below are defined for further use within the procedures.
:*Captain: The officer legally appointed by Nanotrasen as Commanding Officer of the station. This title is only transferable by Central Command.
:*Commanding Officer / CO: An officer appointed to lead the station and its Command department, whether it be the Captain by Nanotrasen, or an Acting CO by Station Command.
:* Command Staff/Station Command: Members of the Command department who lead a department aboard the station.
:* Crew: All sophonts employed by Station Command, or by NT to reside on the station and perform an established function therein. This includes any sophont listed on the Crew Manifest or issued a functional NT identification and access card. Individuals imprisoned by NT, along with those imprisoned during the course of a shift for violations of Space Law, are considered Crew.
:* Judge: An indivudal legally appointed to preside over a criminal or civil trial, as specified within Trial Procedure.
:* Detainee: Any sophont whose free movement has been curtailed by law enforcement on suspicion of criminal activity. They have not, however, been officially charged with a crime.
:* Arrestee: Any sophont who has been formally charged with a crime.
:* Prisoner: Any sophont who has been sentenced for the commission of a crime, or awaiting trial for a capital offense.
:* Permanent Brig/Permabrig/Brig: A secure location for the long-term confinement of Prisoners. Typically outfitted to sustain the basic survival needs of the Prisoners within.
==Right to Refuse Service==
All crew operating within their designated job locations are given the right to refuse service at any time for disorderly or abusive conduct. Additionally, all crew members are permitted to use nonlethal force to remove noncompliant or disorderly individuals only when such persons pose a threat to the safety of staff members, or disrupt the orderly functioning of the station. Service may not be refused to first responders acting to address or mitigate an emergency or crisis situation, unless such conduct is egregiously disorderly or abusive.

==Hiring Procedure==
While Nanotrasen handles the staffing and recruiting needs of the station, Station Command is additionally authorized to hire any sophont into their respective department, as well as terminate the employment of any crew in their respective department per company policy. For a member of Station Command to personally employ a sophont into their department, a contract must be written stating the name of the employee, the department of employment, the position, and finally bearing the stamp of the Station Command member.
=Controlled Items, Substances, & Areas=

== Controlled Items ==
Controlled Items include any item that is restricted from general possession and use. Additionally, any equipment or technology providing insight into the development, production, or procurement of a controlled item is also controlled in and of itself. A list of such items follows:

* Any Controlled Substances, as listed below.
* Any Controlled Armaments, as listed below.
* Electromagnetic pulsing and/or disturbance technology.
* Cryptographic systems, software, or technology.
* Nuclear materials, weapons, and technology.
* Long-range telecommunications and broadcasting technology.
* Astronavigational guidance equipment or technology.
* Telecommunication or signal jamming technology.
* Telecommunications encryption technology.
* Hypodermic spray tools and injectors.
* Cloaking, chameleon, and IFF-inhibiting technology.
* Technology utilizing bluespace as an integral part of its function.
* Teleportation and portal technology.
* Hydraulic or powered equipment designed for the electronic or mechanical bypass of secure-access systems.

Any individual requiring any above item in the course of their job, or for regular function, may request a document of authorization from the relevant departmental head. Such a document must have an itemized list of the approved Controlled Items, the name and position of the holder, and a signed and stamped statement by the authorizing party.

Should the holder commit crimes through the use of such authorized items, the authorizing party may be found guilty of Accessory to said crimes, in addition to Endangerment and Abuse of Power where applicable. The Commanding Officer is also authorized to supervise the approval and revocation of documentation as they see fit.

== Controlled Substances ==
Any individual requiring a Controlled Substance in the course of their job, or for regular function, must request access to a perscription or special dispensation from the Chief Medical Officer. The Psychologist is also permitted to grant prescriptions for psychoactive drugs. Any such document must state the substance(s) being prescribed, the amount(s) where applicable, and the stamp and signature of the authorizing party.

A list of such Substances follow:

* Mindbreaker Toxin and other psionically altering agents.
* Romerol, and other rapid acting biological or chemical agents.
* Desoxyephedrine, and similar stimulants.
* Nocturine, and similar sedatives.
* Phlogiston, and other explosive and/or pyrotechnic compounds.
* Amatoxin, and other toxic and/or poisonous compounds.
* Blissifylovene, Soretizone, Tranquinase, and all similar psychoactives used to aid in mental wellbeing.

== Controlled Armaments ==


Controlled Armaments are grouped into categories of increasing severity.

'''Category A:''' ''Illegal possession of Cat. A controlled armaments may incur a sentence of up to 5min brig for each separate and distinct item, confiscation of the offending item(s), and further legal action as the situation demands.''

* Any object or instrument specifically designed, adapted, or used to cause physical harm in close combat
* Any object or equipment specifically designed or adapted to protect against physical harm caused by weapons, projectiles, or other forms of direct assault
* Any object or instrument specifically designed or adapted to incapacitate or disorient by using light or sound without causing permanent injury
* Any object or equipment specifically designed or adapted for explicitly training purposes that would otherwise fall under another category

'''Category B:''' ''Illegal possession of Cat. B controlled armaments may incur a sentence of up to 10min brig for each separate and distinct item, confiscation of the offending item(s), and further legal action as the situation demands.''

* Any object or instrument specifically designed or adapted to cause physical harm in close combat, which employs a powered system to enhance performance
* Any manually-operated ballistic arms that possess an internal magazine or feeding system, or lack an internal magazine or feeding system altogether

'''Category C:''' ''Illegal possession of Cat. C controlled armaments may incur a sentence of up to 15min brig for each separate and distinct item, confiscation of the offending item(s), and further legal action as the situation demands.''

* Any manually-operated ballistic arms that use an external magazine or feeding system
* Any semi-automatic ballistic arms not easily concealable within a pocket or coat
* Any object or instrument specifically designed or adapted for explicitly less-lethal purposes that would otherwise fall under another category

'''Category D:''' ''Illegal possession of Cat. D controlled armaments may incur a sentence of up to 20min brig for each separate and distinct item, confiscation of the offending item(s), and further legal action as the situation demands.''

* Any semi-automatic ballistic arms that are easily concealable
* Any fully-automatic ballistic arms
* Any laser, plasma, or energy based arms, including ones designed, intended, or used for melee combat.
* Any object or device specifically designed or adapted to cause physical harm through detonation of an explosive charge
* Any object or equipment specifically designed or adapted to protect against both a space environment and physical harm caused by weapons, projectiles, or other forms of direct assault

'''Category E:''' ''Illegal possession of Cat. E controlled armaments may incur a sentence of up to 25min brig for each separate and distinct item, confiscation of the offending item(s), and further legal action as the situation demands.''

* Any crew-served or emplaced weapon
* Any object or instrument specifically designed or adapted to launch large-calibre explosives or projectiles for offensive or defensive purposes
* Any object or instrument specifically designed or adapted to employ chemical, biological, esoteric, radiological, or nuclear hazards for offensive or defensive purposes

Armaments licenses may be issued by the Commanding Officer, Warden, or Head of Security. The license must include the name of the holder, a list of allowed armaments, and a stamped signature from the issuer.

If the holder uses their armaments in the commission of a crime, the issuer may be held liable for accessory to the crimes committed, along with Endangerment and Abuse of Power where applicable.

== Departmental Dispensations ==
Certain personnel may require certain Controlled Items in the course of their job, and as such must be provided exceptions. '''Any member of any department which begins their shift with a controlled item in their possession, within their allocated area, or with a departmental lathe capable of producing said controlled item, is assumed authorized for its possession and use.'''

Additionally, tools and equipment located within emergency lockers are not considered Controlled Items, so long as they are used as intended.

===Logistics===
Members of a station’s Logistics department are permitted to approve any order with the direct permission of an individual with legal access to the contents of that order. Additionally, they may deny any order, at any time, for lack of funds, authority, or any other reason deemed sufficient by their direct superior.

Unlocked crates, orders stored outside the department, and supplies illegally distributed to unauthorized personnel carry the risk of Endangerment of even Black Marketeering charges. Crates of Controlled Items, Substances, or Armaments should be stored securely within the department, with a copy of their invoices on file.

=== Research ===
Epistemics employees are permitted to use their lab spaces as they see fit, with the following caveats:

* Any sophont experimentation must be done with the consent of the test subject, and must not have an undue risk of life. The Mystagogue or CO may terminate any experiment for safety or ethical purposes and at their discretion.
* Testing of any explosives or weapons that risk hull penetration or mass destruction must be done at an off-station site.

Epistemics personnel may also utilise Controlled Items within the confines of designated testing areas and in a manner directly approved jointly by the Mystagogue and by the Head of Security or CO.

Utilizing or storing Controlled items without direct approval, utilizing Controlled Items outside of the testing areas, and distributing Controlled Items to crew constitute criminal offences under Space Law and may additionally incur demotion as punishment.

=== Medical ===
All medical personnel may carry or use Controlled Substances, along with hypodermic tools, in the course of their job functions and in a manner approved by the CMO or CO, with the following caveats:

* Any Controlled Substance with the capability to cause rapid and grievous bodily harm or death may not be carried outside of the chemicals lab or treatment areas without a signed and stamped document of authorization.
* Any Controlled Substance with the capacity to cause harm as a consequence of overdose may not be stocked, stored, or displayed in any area or fashion that leaves such substances open and accessible to the public.
* Any hypodermic tool must be kept secure within locked storage or on the person of an authorized individual.

==High Security Areas==
High Security Areas, or HSAs, should be restricted, and, during standard station operations, secured where applicable or per alert level. They differ from regular secure areas in that they may contain items, technology, or other assets of high importance or value, and must therefore be held safe. Unauthorized persons within HSAs may be guilty of trespass, or of breaking and entering.

Common HSAs for commercial and military vessels are as follows:

* Bridge
* Armory\Gun Deck
* Vault\Strongroom
* Station AI Rooms (Upload, Core, etc.)
* Gravity Generation\Life Support\Engine Rooms
* Telecommunications\Telemetry
* Permanent Brig\Holding Cells

== Sophonts and Synthetics ==
To be defined as a sophont, a being must be able to utilize a structured language, communicate through  the use of written, verbal, and/or body language (or by other means), and possess reasoning and introspection.

Any such being is considered a sophont, and thus a legal person, regardless of their make, origin, disposition, or prior cognition. As part of their rights, they are to be governed under the same laws as any other sophont, and given the ability to press charges as a sophont.

The unauthorised jailbreaking or uplifting of property into the status of Sophont is still a criminal offense however, and those found guilty of doing so may be found guilty of sabotage or vandalism.

An entity’s status as a sophont may be challenged during the process of charging and trialing the individual or another for crimes which utilize the term sophont in the legal language of the crime. The Defense or Prosecution will present evidence indicating that it meets, or does not meet, the criteria above. The Judge will then arbitrate upon the entity's status as a sophont.

Any synthetic/silicon/inorganic entity with a non-sophont status, is to be classified as a standard synthetic entity. Synthetic entities are the property of the party that constructs or employs the entity, unless otherwise stated by relevant contract or legal document. To damage or destroy such an entity is to damage or destroy the aforementioned party’s property.
=Commanding Officer=
==Captain’s Authority==
The Commanding Officer of a station or vessel is afforded several rights, broadly referred to as "Captain's Authority".

While they are formally and legally appointed CO, they are the ultimate authority aboard a vessel until they are directly dismissed by a superior from Central Command.

Additionally, they have the authority to pardon and/or parole any individuals accused and sentenced of Grand Felony, Felony, and Misdemeanor-level sentences if deemed in the best interest of the crew and vessel. The CO may be held liable for accessory to any future criminal acts performed by the pardoned individual, and they must make an announcement to the station stating who was pardoned, for what crimes, and for what reason.

Captain’s Authority carries a responsibility, however; the CO must do everything in their power to protect all entities and assets aboard the station with which they have been entrusted, and must not abandon them while there is a reasonable hope that they may be saved.

Additionally, the legally appointed Captain of a vessel is afforded two additional rights over that of a CO:

* To, with public announcement to the crew, temporarily modify SOP in times of emergency, at the risk of criminal penalties if misused or abused, and
* To deputize members of the crew to carry out law enforcement activity. These deputies are bound by Security Regulations and Space Law, and the Captain may suffer criminal penalties for any crime committed by them.

==Line of Succession==
It is the responsibility of Command to ensure that a station retains a CO immediately at the start of the shift and thereafter. If the CO dies and is unrecoverable, or if a CO is not assigned at the start of the shift, an Acting CO must be selected forthwith per the following guide:

# All active members of Station Command must meet, and choose one of their number to become the Acting CO.
# If no Station Command is alive or on active duty, then each Department must nominate a temporary Delegate. These Delegates must meet and choose an Acting CO from among their number.
# The Acting CO must then duly inform Central Command via fax and make a stationwide announcement.
# Await the end of your shift.

After Central Command has received the results of the Line of Succession, the Acting CO is afforded all prescribed powers of a CO. An access biscuit ''may or may not'' be sent by Centcomm to assist with this. When a legally appointed Captain arrives, it is the express duty of the Acting CO to hand over any and all Captain-related equipment and accesses to the new CO, and to resign themselves to their original role before their temporary promotion.
==Command Promotions==
The CO of the vessel is authorized to promote Crew into Station Command positions if it is determined that the vacancy is a detriment to station productivity. The CO has a duty to ensure that the Crew they promote are of a reasonable level of skill, and can be held liable if they disregard this duty.

Crew members promoted into Station Command positions are considered to be acting members of Station Command, with all rights and responsibilities therein. When NT-appointed Station Command arrive, the acting Command members are required to hand over any specialized equipment (Command ID cards, attire, or tools) and resign themselves to their original position from before their temporary promotion.
==Mutiny==
Should such a situation arise in which the CO is unfit for their position and declines relinquishment of position and power, and where all alternative legal options have been exhausted, officers may be permitted to lead a mutiny. Officers leading a mutiny must inform Central Command of this occurrence before the mutiny has begun.

A mutiny, defined as a coordinated effort to depose the commanding officer or officers of a vessel for committing unlawful acts, requires the crew to neutralize the offending staff with non-lethal force where applicable, and lethal measures and weapons only in acts of self-preservation or when given no other option. The commanding officer or officers, as well as their loyalists, are all bound to Space Law, the current alert level and its corresponding RoE.

Should the mutiny be unsuccessful, only the head officer(s) who approved the mutiny may be charged with sedition and receive a trial, while all mutineers may be demoted, processed by law enforcement, and charged for the crimes they have committed.

Should the mutiny be successful, the head officer(s) who approved the mutiny must select a new Commanding Officer per Line of Succession. The new CO will then sentence the previous heads of staff for their crimes per Space Law.

== Foreign Vessels ==
Should civilian and military vessels receive a docking request from another neutral vessel, they may approve or deny such a request. Any vessel may, with consent from the docking entity, be searched by law enforcement upon arrival, and its crew granted free movement accompanied by an escort at the discretion of the CO or law enforcement officials.

Crew of foreign vessels may be refused entry, at any time and for any reason, and must be returned to, or be escorted to, their own vessel where applicable. Failure to comply may constitute trespass. Docking vessels bearing a warrant or commission represent an exception, and may not be denied entry or be forced to submit to a search.

Crimes committed against the station or its inhabitants, on station or abroad, are grounds to charge the perpetrator according to the laws of the station. Should visiting entities break the law, or be suspected of doing so, and flee aboard their own vessel, law enforcement personnel are authorized to board the vessel in continuous “hot” pursuit and are fully authorized to effect an arrest upon the relevant party.

=Security Regulations=
==Security Jurisdiction==
Law enforcement personnel are bound by trespass and assault laws, and thus cannot operate outside accessible areas, or perform searches without a Probable Cause, a warrant, or a heightened alert level that specifically allows such action. Advanced surgical procedures and cursory implant investigations must be performed by a trained member of the Medical department, operating under their [[Standard Operating Procedure#Standard of Care|Standard of Care]].

However, officers are allowed to trespass into a department in “hot pursuit” of a suspect who has fled from an accessible area, who they have Probable Cause to believe has committed a crime

==Probable Cause==
While actively enforcing the law, officers are held to the standard of Probable Cause. This phrase represents a reasonable suspicion that a crime has been, or is being, committed, and does not require the officer to have solid evidence of criminal activity. Examples of Probable Cause include witnessing criminal activity or credible reports of such.

When judged, Probable Cause is to be interpreted within the context of the entirety of the station’s circumstances at the time of the incident. Probable Cause negates the need of a warrant for searches, and, once concluded, should be promptly reported to the Prosecutor, Warden, or Head of Security for review.

==Detainment and Arrest==
Any sophont may be detained by a law enforcement officer with Probable Cause. In detainment, the officer will inform the Detainee of the crime they are suspected of committing. They may be held on-site or moved to a strategically sound location, restrained at the officer’s discretion, and detained while law enforcement officers determine if they can proceed with an arrest. Such a detention should last no longer than five (5) minutes. A Detainee may not be searched, unless consent is given or they are placed under arrest, and their detention should be concluded within five minutes of its start, by either Arresting them or releasing them.

Any sophont which may have committed a crime, assuming Probable Cause, or has been formally charged with the commission of a crime, may be arrested. In an arrest, the suspect will be restrained by a member of law enforcement, informed of their charges, and taken to the brig for search and processing under Brig Procedure. Any Controlled Items in possession of the Arrestee without licensure or dispensation must be confiscated, along with items used in commission of the crime(s), and will be held indefinitely by law enforcement as described in [[Standard Operating Procedure#Evidence Handling|Evidence Handling]]. Legal counsel may be requested by an Arrestee or Detainee, and must be provided if available.

==Brig Procedure==
When confining an Arrestee within the Brig, they should be transferred to the Warden for processing:

* A full search of the Arrestee and their possessions.
* The confiscation of any Controlled Items or items used in commission of the crime, along with any equipment not befitting a prisoner
* The confining of the Arrestee within a temporary holding cell.
* [[Standard Operating Procedure#Sentencing|Sentencing]] the Arrestee.

If the Arrestee is sentenced for a Capital-level crime, they are to be transferred to the Permanent Brig, pending trial. If the Warden is unavailable, the arresting officer must process the Arrestee as stated above. All confiscated items must be handled as dictated within [[Standard Operating Procedure#Evidence Handling|Evidence Handling]].

==Sentencing==
Any law enforcement individual is authorized to pass sentences on all Grand Felony, Felony and Misdemeanor-level crimes; however, the Prosecutor is responsible for overseeing sentences passed, and is authorized to correct sentences or even acquit them, in accordance with both Space Law and [[Standard Operating Procedure#Paroles and Pardons|Paroles and Pardons]]. Both capital charges and sentences must be placed by the Prosecutor or Court Clerk; if neither are available, the Warden or Head of Security are authorized to press capital charges and request sentencing for them, under Trial Procedure.

In the case that the accused requests appeal for a Grand Felony- or Felony-level sentence, the Court Clerk should be called to preside over a small, swift adjudication, where the Prosecutor and accused will argue their sides. The Clerk will then decide the sentence, or acquittal, of the accused. If the Clerk is unavailable, the Chief Justice or the Warden can perform appeals. If neither are available, any available member of Station Command is authorized to adjudicate on the case.

Additionally, any sentence meeting or exceeding twenty-five (25) minutes, regardless of the severity of the crime(s) committed, will require a trial. If the total sentence still meets or exceeds twenty-five minutes after the conclusion of a lawful trial, the Judge is fully authorized and encouraged to upgrade their sentence to Extended Confinement.

Once a sentence has commenced, it must be concluded at or before the agreed-upon time.

== Evidence Handling ==
When evidence of a crime is secured, it is the responsibility of the arresting officer or Warden to properly handle it, at the penalty of Obstruction of Justice and/or demotion.

Evidence should be organized by individual and crime, and stored together (e.g., in a bag, in one separate locker, etc) and then placed in an area locked behind security access.

If a prisoner is released from a temporary holding cell OR the Brig, any of their equipment that is neither a Controlled Item nor used in the commission of their crimes must be returned to them.

== Rules of Engagement ==
Law enforcement personnel hold a Category D Armaments License, and are authorized at all times to use lethal force to the extent necessary to neutralize adversaries under any of the following circumstances:

* If the adversary’s number or strength leave the officer at a severe tactical disadvantage.
* If the adversary exhibits a clear and present danger to the vessel by physical means.
* If the adversary poses a significant threat of serious bodily injury or death to the officer or others.
* If the adversary presents an existential threat to the chain of command by illegal means.
* If the adversary cannot be reasonably subdued through non-lethal means without great bodily harm to the officer.

…wherein an “adversary” is an entity that demonstrates a hostile intent, commits or directly contributes to a hostile act that does not constitute an actual attack, or is actively attacking the vessel or its crew.

Despite their allowance of lethal force, Security is required to follow the Rules of Engagement of the current Alert Level, as outlined within [[Alert Procedure]].

== Martial Law ==
Martial Law may only be declared by Central Command. Under Martial Law:
* Arrests, searches, and departmental raids may be performed at the discretion of security personnel and without a warrant.
* Security is fully authorised to take whatever actions deemed necessary to neutralise or repel station threats.
* Security is authorized to summarily execute station threats.
* Security is no longer bound to the Rules of Engagement.
* Security is not obligated to provide any medical care to prisoners and detainees, including revival.

== Armory Procedure ==
The armory and its usage are governed by the Warden. The Warden is responsible for stocking, distributing, and recording the collection of weapons used by the station during the shift. They are also afforded the authority to arm security at their discretion, so long as the weaponry distributed is in appropriate response to [[Alert Procedure]].

All weaponry distributed from armory is issued on a temporary basis. While issued, the weaponry remains as station property, and the wielder assumes a duty to protect the weapon and return it to the Warden when ordered. No non-crew may be issued weaponry from the armory.

The Warden is accountable for responsibly issuing weapons. Any weaponry issued during a heightened alert level must be returned when the alert has been lowered, or when the threat is no longer present. The weaponry issued must be proportionate to the threat posed, and explosives should not be used unless absolutely necessary.
==Treatment of Prisoners==
Prisoners have certain rights that must be upheld by law enforcement and Station Command. ''Prisoners must be provided with the following'':

* Adequate medical care and moral, spiritual, or legal counseling if it is requested and available.
* Access to the Common and Prison radio channels only while serving their sentence. This right may be revoked should it be abused.
* Standard prisoner clothing must always be available for prisoners.
* Confiscated clothing should be returned upon request, except in the case of Extended Confinement or if the clothing in question poses a clear risk to prisoner or crew safety.
* Food and water for organic prisoners must be available and given on request.
* Power for silicon prisoners such as IPCs and cyborgs, at minimum a cyborg recharging station must be provided.
* Should the holding cells or Permabrig become uninhabitable, prisoners must be securely and safely relocated to another area for confinement, until the holding cells or Permabrig are returned to a serviceable state.
* Prisoners should be granted freedom of movement within their holding area unless there is an undue risk to life and limb.

Additionally, prisoners sentenced to Extended Confinement have certain rights but also '''more firm restrictions that must be upheld by law enforcement''':

* Visitation may be permitted only for prisoners sentenced to Extended Confinement. One person may visit such a prisoner for a period of no longer than ten minutes. A reason must be provided for the visit, and the visitor must consent to a search of their belongings. The prisoner is then unable to receive another visitor for another ten minutes.
* Prisoners may request retrial for capital crimes; these requests may be refused depending on the discretion and availability of the court clerk, chief justice, or at the discretion of the warden or head of station security.
* Prisoners may request or may otherwise be given parole with a hearing by the Chief Justice, Court Clerk, or in their absence, the head of station security or commanding officer (see Paroles and Pardons).

Should prisoners repeatedly and maliciously antagonize law enforcement, to an extent where continued extended confinement becomes infeasible, the warden is fully authorized and encouraged to upgrade the relevant prisoners’ sentences to Exfiltration summarily.

Moreover, prisoners are liable for any and all crimes that they commit while held either in the temporary holding cells or the Permanent Brig, and may receive trial for more restrictive punishments if their actions warrant a capital sentence.

==Paroles and Pardons==
Prisoners may be allowed parole, per the discretion of the Warden, the Head of Security, or the CO. Alternatively, they may request a parole hearing as described within Trial Procedure.

Prisoners seeking parole may request legal counsel before the hearing, but they must represent themselves. A prisoner who is granted parole is to be treated as a member of the station’s crew with all benefits and responsibilities thereof, and is encouraged to seek gainful employment from relevant command staff.

Additionally, a pardon can be issued to any entity accused of, or sentenced to, crimes, by the arresting officer, the Judge of a trial, or the Warden in the case of those within the permanent brig, if deemed in the best interest of the crew and vessel, and when the circumstances of the defendant or their offense warrant a suspension of their sentence.

=Justice Regulations=
==Pressing Charges==
===Criminal Charges===
Any crew member may press charges against any other crew member. An individual may be charged of a crime if and only if it can be argued beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused had committed an act in the nature and fashion as described by a particular criminal charge.

Multiple counts of one crime can be charged. For illegal actions against the station abroad, each incident separated by a reasonable period of inaction, lawful conduct, or another crime is interpreted as one count. For crimes directly bereaving a person (violent acts, theft of personal property etc.), the same applies in addition to each victim being one count. In the case of possession, theft, or any incident involving several separate and distinct items, one charge may be applied per relevant item.

Charges that are a direct escalation of one another in nature cannot be simultaneously held against the perpetrator if they pertain to the same incident and the same victim/item (if applicable). Then, only the most severe of these charges applies. Additionally, if one charge incorporates another charge within its definition or description, the perpetrator cannot be held accountable for both; rather, only the most severe of these charges applies.
===Civil Charges===
Any crew member can sue any other crew member for inflicting them with damages caused by a breach of duty. To sue is to request compensation for said damages. To do so, the victim must prove:
*'''Damages:''' That the victim was inflicted with an emotional, physical, or monetary damage
*'''Breach of duty:''' That the defendant had a duty which they failed to uphold(e.g., a duty to not endanger crew, a duty to act respectfully), leading to the victim being inflicted with a damage
*'''Severity:''' That the damage was severe enough to warrant the compensation requested
Compensation can either be explicitly specified by the victim or left for the court to decide. Either way, the court is free to modify the compensation as it sees fit. Most often, compensation is rendered in the form of court orders compelling a crew member to do something (e.g., return an item, make an apology, or permanently avoid a certain area). Court orders should be written and stamped with the notary stamp.

==Court Orders==
The individuals specified in the three sections below can issue Court Orders, which are legally-enforced documents that carry the penalty of an Obstruction of Justice charge and forced compliance with the order by security. Each order has its own requirements and authorized issuers, but are all implied to require '''''the stamp (where applicable) and signature of the issuer to be valid.'''''
===Warrants===
Warrants represent official orders to the security department, issued by relevant officers or the Justice Department. Warrants are only valid when issued by either the Chief Justice or Court Clerk, or in both of their absences, the Commanding Officer or head of station Security.

* Individual Warrants may order the search or detainment of an individual, or the arrest of the individual with evidence. This may also include surgical procedures, cursory implant inspections, or any other invasive searches with both probable cause and evidence. These warrants should include a name, the actions prescribed (detainment, search, arrest, etc.), and a description if applicable.
* Search Warrants may order the search of an entire departmental area, by force if necessary, and may order the arrest of listed individuals implicated in a crime or crimes with probable cause and evidence. Search Warrants should include an area, a brief description of the probable cause, and a list of individuals if applicable.

===Injunctions===
The Chief Justice, Commanding Officer, or Judge of a trial are fully authorized to issue injunctions: legally-binding, written orders restricting Inhabitants from doing something disruptive to station productivity or personal rights.
These may be issued on discretion or as relief for Civil Trials. Injunctions may not compel someone to violate Space Law or SOP, and the issuer is liable for abuse of power charges if this is misused. An injunction must include a list of affected names and a detailed description of the restrictions to be valid.

===Subpoenas===
The Chief Justice, Court Clerk, or Judge of a trial may issue Subpoenas, which are trial-related Court Orders compelling an individual to produce evidence or make themselves present at a location for court. A subpoena can order an individual to:

* Appear as a witness, defendant, plaintiff, or prosecution;
* Produce evidence for a trial;
* Appear for questioning in deposition.

A subpoena must include a list of names, a detailed description of evidence requested or reason for appearing, and a reasonable time frame no shorter than 3 minutes. The individuals summoned by the subpoena must be informed of its presence for it to be a valid order. This can be done via general announcement, fax, verbal announcement, or otherwise.

=== Affidavits ===
An Affidavit is a legal document, consisting of a formal written statement of witness. An Affidavit must be written by the witness, or Affiant, who must state their relation to the incident at hand, and must be signed and stamped (if applicable) by a member of Security, Justice, or Command, who is verifying that the contents of the Affidavit are true to the best of their knowledge. The witness to the Affidavit must not be directly connected to the incident.

Affidavits are considered valid witness statements for use in a trial (see Trial Procedure, below), and can be used either in tandem with a verbal witness statement, or to obtain testimony from an affiant whose job requirements and/or personal circumstances make attending a trial unfeasible.

An affidavit may be impeached- and thus removed from evidence- if the Prosecution or Defense can introduce testimony or other evidence that directly contradicts the statements recorded within the Affidavit. The Affiant may then be liable for criminal charges.

=Trial Procedure=
A trial may be requested for civil disputes and capital charges. Civil charges may be refused, depending on the availability and discretion of a potential Judge; however, capital crimes require a trial. This also includes non-capital trials required as dictated within Sentencing guidelines. Miscellaneous trials, such as those described within Paroles and Pardons, only require the Judge and the defendant.

Criminal trials may be waived if a suspect pleads guilty to a member of the Justice or Security department, or to station command. Their sentence should be passed by a Judge immediately, without the need for a full hearing. The Judge should also sentence the defendant summarily if they are held in contempt of court during the trial.

The trial takes the form of an arbitration court hearing, presided over by an appointed Judge, and including adequate Prosecution and Defense, as dictated below. All charges, arguments, and evidence must be filed with the Judge before the case begins. The trial shall begin when the Defense, Prosecution, and Judge are all present and ready to begin. A trial does not need to be open to the public.

The Judge is charged with ensuring the trial is completed in a timely manner, and is granted the power to charge someone with Contempt of Court, under Space Law, if they disrupt the case. Suitable Judges should be chosen from the following list, in sequential order:

# The Chief Justice
# The Clerk
# An impartial member of the Justice department.
# An impartial member of Station Command.
# The Warden.

The Defense should ideally be a member of the Justice department assigned to argue in favor of the defendant; if none are available, the defendant may choose to represent themselves.

The Prosecution should ideally be the Prosecutor; if they are unavailable, the case should be prosecuted by an unbiased member of Station Command or a law enforcement officer, in that order.

If there is not a viable and/or willing Defense or Prosecution, the Judge is fully authorized and strongly encouraged to pass a summary sentence of Extended Confinement until an adequate trial can be held.

==Criminal Trials==
A criminal case should take no longer than 25 minutes in total. Criminal cases should either have security personnel present, or plan to have them present by the end of the trial.
:#The judge brings the court in session.
:#Prosecution opens the proceedings, stating the charges and introducing witnesses and exhibits that will be brought forward during the presentation of evidence. They may also recommend a sentence to the judge, appropriate to the charge based on their opening statement.
:#Defense enters their plea- Guilty or Not Guilty.
:#If Guilty, the Judge is authorized to immediately pass a ruling, as stated below.
:#If Not Guilty, they are to provide their own opening statement and introduce their own witnesses and exhibits where applicable.
:#Presentation of evidence follows, lead by Prosecution, then Defense.
:#*Cross-examination may be requested following submission of individual exhibits or witnesses, and granted at the Judge's discretion.
:#Finally, closing statements are made by the Prosecution, Defense, and Prosecution once more due to burden of proof. No new evidence can be introduced within a closing statement.
:#A ruling will be issued by the Judge, written down, and stamped with the Notary stamp, the Judge's stamp, and their signature.
:#The Judge adjourns the court. Any present or soon-to-be-present Security personnel will then enact the ruling.

== Civil Trials ==
Civil cases do not require Prosecution or Defense, but they may receive assistance from either both before and during the case. Both the defendant and plaintiff must be made to summon at the court, if a party does not appear out of either refusal or negligence, or fails to comply with a court order from a civil trial, that party may be charged with contempt of court, a felony. A civil case involves seeking damages from a defendant, which could be monetary, an item, or otherwise. A civil case should take no longer than 15 minutes in total.

# The Judge brings the court into session.
# Plaintiff opens proceedings by stating the damages, before introducing witnesses and exhibits that will be brought forward during presentation of evidence. They may also reccomend civil relief to the judge, appropriate to the damages listed wthin their opening statement.
# Defendant follows with their opening statement, contradicting the Plaintiff's theories and assertions. They will also introduce their own witnesses and exhibits, where applicable.
# Presentation of evidence follows, led by the Plaintiff, then the Defendant.
#* Cross-examination may be requested following submission of individual exhibits or witnesses, and granted at the Judge's discretion.
# Finally, closing statements are made by the Plaintiff, Defense, and Plaintiff once more due to burden of proof. No new evidence should be introduced or referenced by these statements.
# A ruling will be made by the Judge, written, and stamped by the Notary stamp, the Judge's stamp, and signed by the Judge.
# The Judge adjourns court.

Any ruling shall then be enacted; if a party refuses to follow through with the ruling, they may suffer criminal penalties.

== Presentation of Evidence ==

===Eyewitness Testimony===
Any sophont or other entity willing and capable of presenting themselves before court under oath and present at the scene of the crime as a bystander or a victim at the time of its commission, may offer eyewitness testimony before the court at request of defense or prosecution. Extra time may be granted to either side at the behest of the Judge to allow for witnesses not currently present.

===Objection to Testimony===
Any witness that falls under the following conditions may be excused as a witness or have their testimony deemed inadmissible:
:*The witness lacks the mental, intellectual, or other capacity to understand the context of the case.
:*The witness's inclusion will cause substantial cost or delay to the case, proceedings, or upkeep of the station.
:*The witness is the judge.
===General Objections===
Both parties in a trial may object to testimony to have the testimony deemed inadmissible, move past the question, or rephrase a question to keep a trial within time limit:
:* '''Hearsay:''' The witness testifies using an out-of-court statement by an individual not present in court, thereby rendering it impossible to verify. This testimony will be inadmissible.
:* '''Asked and answered:''' A question is posed that has already been answered previously by a witness. Such a question must be skipped.
:* '''Narrative:''' A question is posed that would require a significantly long answer with multiple facts, or when the witness chooses to answer a question in this way. The question must be reworded, or the witness must be reminded to answer promptly and stay on topic.

Objections are completely at the discretion of the judge, who does not always need to sustain an objection even if it is within these guidelines. It is up to the judge to decide if an objection is proper or necessary to keep the trial quick and fair.

==Procedural Defense==
Whereas a defendant is placed on trial, they are granted the privilege to challenge the legitimacy of charges or claims brought against them by the legal process. Any of the following may be invoked:
:*Issue Preclusion/Double Jeopardy Clause: accused persons may not be tried on the same charges following an acquittal or conviction, except in the case of acquittal and subsequent credible admission of guilt.
:*Entrapment Clause: accused persons found to be induced or coerced by law enforcement into the commission of the crimes listed in the charges may be acquitted or have their sentence reduced.
:*Exclusionary Clause: evidence collected and/or analyzed in violation of accused persons’ rights under law may be inadmissible in court.
=Medical Regulations=
==Standard of Care==

Upon agreeing to provide medical care, staff assume the following duties of care:

* They must provide a reasonable level of skillful, quality care
* They must not make critical errors resulting in major personal injury or death, at the risk of criminal and civil liability.
* They must show diligence in providing treatment, both inside and outside of the medical department area during their shift.
* They must provide privacy to patients in non-emergency situations.
* If they have limited resources, they must allocate what resources are available to them via triage.
* They must not provide treatment that would breach Space Law or violate ethical principles.
* They must ensure that invasive procedures or surgeries, including implant removals or inspections, are performed by trained personnel and properly given authorization via a valid search warrant. The need for a warrant is removed during a Code Gamma or similar alert status.

==DNRs==
Do Not Resuscitate (DNR) orders are commands issued to medical personnel to restrict the revival of a specified individual. DNRs are issued for the following reasons:

* Lawful executions;
* Suicide in the custody of law enforcement, verified by the Corpsman.
* Patient refusal.

DNRs that do not involve execution must be verified by the CMO before taking effect.

==Medical Evaluation==
Given good medical reason and with documentation, the Chief Medical Officer of a vessel may declare any on-duty personnel unfit for duty and order them demoted from their position. This includes the Commanding Officer, who may not overrule this procedure.

In order for a medical evaluation to be considered lawfully applicable, the CMO and relevant head of department must both agree that the specified crewmate is unfit for duty in order to proceed with the demotion. In the case of the Commanding Officer, Central Command should be contacted as soon as possible.

==Quarantine==
Medical staff are afforded the right to quarantine individuals that currently suffer from infectious or contagious diseases, and may confine them within pre-designated quarantine areas in the course of treatment, until the point that they are no longer infectious or harmful to the rest of the crew.

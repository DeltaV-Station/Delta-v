This page covers the standardized guidelines and procedures aboard the station, but are not written in law; be aware that in cases of dire emergency the commanding officer or certain individuals are authorized to temporarily alter current SOP as they see fit, at the risk of criminal penalties in the case of misuse or abuse! Make sure to look at [[Alert Procedure]] for guidelines that change based on the current alert level.
=General Regulations=

== '''Definitions''' ==
The terms specified below are defined for further use within the procedures.
:*Captain: The officer legally appointed by NanoTrasen as Commanding Officer of the station. This title is only transferable by Central Command.
:*Commanding Officer / CO: An officer appointed to lead the station and its Command department, whether it be the Captain by NanoTrasen, or an Acting CO by Station Command.
:* Command Staff/Station Command: Members of the Command department who lead a department aboard the station.
:* Crew: All Employees employed by Station Command, or by NT to reside on the station and perform an established function therein. This includes any Employee listed on the Crew Manifest or issued a functional NT identification and access card. Individuals imprisoned by NT, along with those imprisoned during the course of a shift for violations of Space Law, are considered Crew.
:* Judge: An individual legally appointed to preside over a hearing, as specified within Hearing Procedure.
:* Arrestee: Any Employee who has been formally charged with a crime.
:* Prisoner: Any Employee who has been sentenced for the commission of a crime, or awaiting a hearing for a capital offense.
:* Permanent Brig/Permabrig/Brig: A secure location for the long-term confinement of Prisoners. Typically outfitted to sustain the basic survival needs of the Prisoners within.

==Right to Refuse Service==
All crew operating within their designated job locations are given the right to refuse service at any time for disorderly or abusive conduct. Additionally, all crew members are permitted to use nonlethal force to remove noncompliant or disorderly individuals only when such persons pose a threat to the safety of staff members, or disrupt the orderly functioning of the station. Service may not be refused to first responders acting to address or mitigate an emergency or crisis situation, unless such conduct is egregiously disorderly or abusive.

= Entity Definitions =
The following definitions are provided to clarify the legal protections- and obligations- that Standard Operating Procedures and Space Law provide to any given entity. Unless explicitly covered by a more distinctive term, all Entities are to be treated as such until clarification is provided.

== Entity ==
Any individual with a distinct existence. Entities may also encompass a plurality of identities contained within a single physical form. NanoTrasen does not require Entities be offered the protections of Standard Operating Procedure, Space Law, or Rules of Engagement unless further defined below. Security Officers are encouraged to be reasonable with their use of force regarding circumstances, especially if Entity's termination would leave lawsuits or tarnish reputation for NanoTrasen.
== Pet ==
Any Entity that is provided to NanoTrasen Space Stations - either through the station's Logistics Department, or brought on board by the crew - for the purposes of emotional support. Any harm against such a Pet may render the offender liable to the crime of Animal Cruelty.
Examples of Pets include, but are not limited to:
:* Renault the Fox
:* Smile the Rainbow Slime
:* Laika the Guard Dog
:* Silvia the Medical Cobra
:* a corgi, purchased by Station Logistics
:* hand-held "personal AI" devices

== Synthetic ==
Any Entity consisting primarily of non-organic matter, designed and/or constructed by NanoTrasen or its Employees for the purpose of performing tasks aboard a Space Station. Synthetics are bound by software limitations, typically referred to as Synthetic or Silicon Laws, and physically incorporated into their chassis. Any damage to a Synthetic- including un-authorized modification of their Laws- may leave the offender liable to charges of Sabotage. Irrevocable destruction of a Synthetic may leave the offender liable to the crime of Grand Sabotage.
Examples of Synthetics include, but are not limited to:
:* Crew-constructed Cyborgs
:* The Station AI
:* Positronic Brains

== Employee ==
Any Entity who has a contract with NanoTrasen.
Typically, these individuals possess all of the following:
:* A communications headset (or similar communications capability) outfitted with encryption keys relevant to their assigned job function.
:* An ID card with their name and job function, pre-programmed with door access relevant to aforementioned job function.
:* Company-approved attire for an individual of their job function.
In situations where an individual lacks one or more of these items, law enforcement officials are encouraged to use their best judgement, and mitigate any risk of liability to charges of Endangerment or Abuse of Power.
Harm or death of an Employee may leave the offender liable to the crimes of Assault, Manslaughter, or even Murder.
Examples of Employees include, but are not limited to:
:* All crew present on the Space Station, including those who are removed from cryogenic stasis during the course of a shift.
:* Any crewmate arriving from a different NanoTrasen Space Station, due to navigation errors, disasters, or similar.
:* Individuals imprisoned by NT, along with those imprisoned during the course of a shift for violations of Space Law.
:* Any and all members of NanoTrasen Central Command, including Emergency Response Team soldiers and Central Commanders.
In cases where there is reasonable doubt as to the identity of a member of Central Command, the Commanding Officer is encouraged to request clarity from Central Command themselves.

Any Employees that are fired by Station Command are still considered Employees until Central Command can confirm their contract termination.

=== Provisional Employees ===
Provisional Employees are a special subcategory of Employee. During the course of a shift, events may lead to an Entity, or Entities, arriving aboard the station who wish to be employed by NanoTrasen. The Head of Personnel, alongside any relevant departmental head, may accept the Entity into NanoTrasen's employ provisionally.

In such a case, the Head of Personnel must create a document listing the Provisional Employee's name and assigned job function, along with any physical features deemed necessary to identify them. This must be signed and stamped (where applicable) by the Head of Personnel, their relevant departmental head, and the Provisional Employee. A copy must be kept within the Head of Personnel's records, and with the Provisional Employee if possible.

Provisional Employees serve "at will", and may have their employment revoked at any time by Central or Station Command authorities.
=Controlled Items, Substances, & Areas=

== Controlled Items ==
Controlled Items include any item that is restricted from general possession and use. Additionally, any equipment or technology providing insight into the development, production, or procurement of a controlled item is also controlled in and of itself. A list of such items follows:

* Any Controlled Substances, as listed below.
* Any Controlled Armaments, as listed below.
* Electromagnetic pulsing and/or disturbance technology.
* Cryptographic systems, software, or technology.
* Nuclear materials, weapons, and technology.
* Long-range telecommunications and broadcasting technology.
* Astronavigational guidance equipment or technology.
* Telecommunication or signal jamming technology.
* Telecommunications encryption technology.
* Hypodermic spray tools and injectors.
* Cloaking, chameleon, and IFF-inhibiting technology.
* Technology utilizing bluespace as an integral part of its function.
* Teleportation and portal technology.
* Hydraulic or powered equipment designed for the electronic or mechanical bypass of secure-access systems.

Any individual requiring any above item in the course of their job, or for regular function, may request a document of authorization from the relevant departmental head. Such a document must have an itemized list of the approved Controlled Items, the name and position of the holder, and a signed and stamped statement by the authorizing party.

Should the holder commit crimes through the use of such authorized items, the authorizing party may be found guilty of Accessory to said crimes, in addition to Endangerment and Abuse of Power where applicable. The Commanding Officer is also authorized to supervise the approval and revocation of documentation as they see fit.

== Controlled Substances ==
Any individual requiring a Controlled Substance in the course of their job, or for regular function, must request access to a perscription or special dispensation from the Chief Medical Officer. The Psychologist is also permitted to grant prescriptions for psychoactive drugs. Any such document must state the substance(s) being prescribed, the amount(s) where applicable, and the stamp and signature of the authorizing party.

A list of such Substances follow:

* Mindbreaker Toxin and other psionically altering agents.
* Romerol, and other rapid acting biological or chemical agents.
* Desoxyephedrine, and similar stimulants.
* Nocturine, and similar sedatives.
* Phlogiston, and other explosive and/or pyrotechnic compounds.
* Amatoxin, and other toxic and/or poisonous compounds.
* Blissifylovene, Soretizone, Tranquinase, and all similar psychoactives used to aid in mental wellbeing.

== Controlled Armaments ==


Controlled Armaments are grouped into categories of increasing severity. If the offender possesses several categories of contraband, only the highest severity of said items should be charged.

'''Category A:''' ''Illegal possession of Cat. A controlled armaments may incur a sentence of up to 5min brig and further legal action as the situation demands.''

* Any object or instrument specifically designed, adapted, or used to cause physical harm in close combat
* Any object or equipment specifically designed or adapted to protect against physical harm caused by weapons, projectiles, or other forms of direct assault
* Any object or instrument specifically designed or adapted to incapacitate or disorient by using light or sound without causing permanent injury
* Any object or equipment specifically designed or adapted for explicitly training purposes that would otherwise fall under another category

'''Category B:''' ''Illegal possession of Cat. B controlled armaments may incur a sentence of up to 10min brig and further legal action as the situation demands.''

* Any object or instrument specifically designed or adapted to cause physical harm in close combat, which employs a powered system to enhance performance
* Any manually-operated ballistic arms that possess an internal magazine or feeding system, or lack an internal magazine or feeding system altogether

'''Category C:''' ''Illegal possession of Cat. C controlled armaments may incur a sentence of up to 15min brig and further legal action as the situation demands.''

* Any manually-operated ballistic arms that use an external magazine or feeding system
* Any semi-automatic ballistic arms not easily concealable within a pocket or coat
* Any object or instrument specifically designed or adapted for explicitly less-lethal purposes that would otherwise fall under another category

'''Category D:''' ''Illegal possession of Cat. D controlled armaments may incur a sentence of up to 20min brig and further legal action as the situation demands.''

* Any semi-automatic ballistic arms that are easily concealable
* Any fully-automatic ballistic arms
* Any laser, plasma, or energy based arms, including ones designed, intended, or used for melee combat.
* Any object or device specifically designed or adapted to cause physical harm through detonation of an explosive charge
* Any object or equipment specifically designed or adapted to protect against both a space environment and physical harm caused by weapons, projectiles, or other forms of direct assault

'''Category E:''' ''Illegal possession of Cat. E controlled armaments may incur a sentence of up to 25min brig and further legal action as the situation demands.''

* Any crew-served or emplaced weapon
* Any object or instrument specifically designed or adapted to launch large-calibre explosives or projectiles for offensive or defensive purposes
* Any object or instrument specifically designed or adapted to employ chemical, biological, esoteric, radiological, or nuclear hazards for offensive or defensive purposes

Armaments licenses may be issued by the Commanding Officer, Warden, or Head of Security. The license must include the name of the holder, a list of allowed armaments, and a stamped signature from the issuer.

If the holder uses their armaments in the commission of a crime, the issuer may be held liable for accessory to the crimes committed, along with Endangerment and Abuse of Power where applicable.

== Departmental Dispensations ==
Certain personnel may require certain Controlled Items in the course of their job, and as such must be provided exceptions. '''Any member of any department which begins their shift with a controlled item in their possession, within their allocated area, or with a departmental lathe capable of producing said controlled item, is assumed authorized for its possession and use.'''

Additionally, tools and equipment located within emergency lockers are not considered Controlled Items, so long as they are used as intended.

===Logistics===
Members of a station’s Logistics department are permitted to approve any order with the direct permission of an individual with legal access to the contents of that order. Additionally, they may deny any order, at any time, for lack of funds, authority, or any other reason deemed sufficient by their direct superior.

Unlocked crates, orders stored outside the department, and supplies illegally distributed to unauthorized personnel carry the risk of Endangerment of even Black Marketeering charges. Crates of Controlled Items, Substances, or Armaments should be stored securely within the department, with a copy of their invoices on file.

=== Research ===
Epistemics employees are permitted to use their lab spaces as they see fit, with the following caveats:

* Any Employee experimentation must be done with the consent of the test subject, and must not have an undue risk of life. The Mystagogue or CO may terminate any experiment for safety or ethical purposes and at their discretion.
* Testing of any explosives or weapons that risk hull penetration or mass destruction must be done at an off-station site.

Epistemics personnel may also utilise Controlled Items within the confines of designated testing areas and in a manner directly approved jointly by the Mystagogue and by the Head of Security or CO.

Utilizing or storing Controlled items without direct approval, utilizing Controlled Items outside of the testing areas, and distributing Controlled Items to crew constitute criminal offences under Space Law and may additionally incur demotion as punishment.

=== Medical ===
All medical personnel may carry or use Controlled Substances, along with hypodermic tools, in the course of their job functions and in a manner approved by the CMO or CO, with the following caveats:

* Any Controlled Substance with the capability to cause rapid and grievous bodily harm or death may not be carried outside of the chemicals lab or treatment areas without a signed and stamped document of authorization.
* Any Controlled Substance with the capacity to cause harm as a consequence of overdose may not be stocked, stored, or displayed in any area or fashion that leaves such substances open and accessible to the public.
* Any hypodermic tool must be kept secure within locked storage or on the person of an authorized individual.

==High Security Areas==
High Security Areas, or HSAs, should be restricted, and, during standard station operations, secured where applicable or per alert level. They differ from regular secure areas in that they may contain items, technology, or other assets of high importance or value, and must therefore be held safe. Unauthorized persons within HSAs may be guilty of trespass, or of breaking and entering.

Common HSAs for commercial and military vessels are as follows:

* Bridge
* Armory\Gun Deck
* Vault\Strongroom
* Station AI Rooms (Upload, Core, etc.)
* Gravity Generation\Life Support\Engine Rooms
* Telecommunications\Telemetry
* Permanent Brig\Holding Cells


=Commanding Officer=
==Captain’s Authority==
The Commanding Officer of a station or vessel is afforded several rights, broadly referred to as "Captain's Authority".

While they are formally and legally appointed CO, they are the ultimate authority aboard a vessel until they are directly dismissed by a superior from Central Command.

Additionally, they have the authority to pardon and/or parole any individuals accused and sentenced of Grand Felony, Felony, and Misdemeanor-level sentences if deemed in the best interest of the crew and vessel. The CO may be held liable for accessory to any future criminal acts performed by the pardoned individual, and they must make an announcement to the station stating who was pardoned, for what crimes, and for what reason.

Captain’s Authority carries a responsibility, however; the CO must do everything in their power to protect all entities and assets aboard the station with which they have been entrusted, and must not abandon them while there is a reasonable hope that they may be saved.

Additionally, the legally appointed Captain of a vessel is afforded two additional rights over that of a CO:

* To, with public announcement to the crew, temporarily modify SOP in times of emergency, at the risk of criminal penalties if misused or abused, and
* To deputize members of the crew to carry out law enforcement activity. These deputies are bound by Security Regulations and Space Law, and the Captain may suffer criminal penalties for any crime committed by them.

==Line of Succession==
It is the responsibility of Command to ensure that a station retains a CO immediately at the start of the shift and thereafter. If the CO dies and is unrecoverable, or if a CO is not assigned at the start of the shift, an Acting CO must be selected forthwith per the following guide:

# All active members of Station Command must meet, and choose one of their number to become the Acting CO.
# If no Station Command is alive or on active duty, then each Department must nominate a temporary Delegate. These Delegates must meet and choose an Acting CO from among their number.
# The Acting CO must then duly inform Central Command via fax and make a stationwide announcement.
# Await the end of your shift.

After Central Command has received the results of the Line of Succession, the Acting CO is afforded all prescribed powers of a CO. An access biscuit ''may or may not'' be sent by Centcomm to assist with this. When a legally appointed Captain arrives, it is the express duty of the Acting CO to hand over any and all Captain-related equipment and accesses to the new CO, and to resign themselves to their original role before their temporary promotion.
==Command Promotions==
The CO of the vessel is authorized to promote Crew into Station Command positions if it is determined that the vacancy is a detriment to station productivity. The CO has a duty to ensure that the Crew they promote are of a reasonable level of skill, and can be held liable if they disregard this duty.

Crew members promoted into Station Command positions are considered to be acting members of Station Command, with all rights and responsibilities therein. When NT-appointed Station Command arrive, the acting Command members are required to hand over any specialized equipment (Command ID cards, attire, or tools) and resign themselves to their original position from before their temporary promotion.
==Mutiny==
Should such a situation arise in which the CO is unfit for their position and declines relinquishment of position and power, and where all alternative legal options have been exhausted, officers may be permitted to lead a mutiny. Officers leading a mutiny must inform Central Command of this occurrence before the mutiny has begun.

A mutiny, defined as a coordinated effort to depose the commanding officer or officers of a vessel for committing unlawful acts, requires the crew to neutralize the offending staff with non-lethal force where applicable, and lethal measures and weapons only in acts of self-preservation or when given no other option. The commanding officer or officers, as well as their loyalists, are all bound to Space Law, the current alert level and its corresponding RoE.

Should the mutiny be unsuccessful, only the head officer(s) who approved the mutiny may be charged with sedition and receive a hearing, while all mutineers may be demoted, processed by law enforcement, and charged for the crimes they have committed.

Should the mutiny be successful, the head officer(s) who approved the mutiny must select a new Commanding Officer per Line of Succession. The new CO will then sentence the previous heads of staff for their crimes per Space Law.

== Foreign Vessels ==
Should civilian and military vessels receive a docking request from another neutral vessel, they may approve or deny such a request. Any vessel may, with consent from the docking entity, be searched by law enforcement upon arrival, and its crew granted free movement accompanied by an escort at the discretion of the CO or law enforcement officials. Crew of vessels legally docked on NanoTrasen Stations are considered to be in contract with NanoTrasen and as such are protected by Space Law, Standard operating Procedure and the Rules of Engagement.

Crew of foreign vessels may be refused entry, at any time and for any reason, and must be returned to, or be escorted to, their own vessel where applicable. Failure to comply may constitute trespass. Docking vessels bearing a warrant or commission represent an exception, and may not be denied entry or be forced to submit to a search.

Crimes committed against the station or its inhabitants, on station or abroad, are grounds to charge the perpetrator according to the laws of the station. Should visiting entities break the law, or be suspected of doing so, and flee aboard their own vessel, law enforcement personnel are authorized to board the vessel in continuous “hot” pursuit and are fully authorized to effect an arrest upon the relevant party.

=Security and Justice Regulations=
==Security Jurisdiction==
Law enforcement personnel are bound by trespass and assault laws, and thus cannot operate outside accessible areas, or perform searches without a Probable Cause, or a [[Standard Operating Procedure#Warrants|warrant]]. Advanced surgical procedures and cursory implant investigations must be performed by a trained member of the Medical department, operating under their [[Standard Operating Procedure#Standard of Care|Standard of Care]].

However, officers are allowed to trespass into a department in “hot pursuit” of a suspect who has fled from an accessible area, who they have Probable Cause to believe has committed a crime

==Probable Cause==
While actively enforcing the law, officers are held to the standard of Probable Cause. This phrase represents a reasonable suspicion that a crime has very recently been, or is currently being, committed, and does not require the officer to have solid evidence of criminal activity. Examples of Probable Cause include witnessing criminal activity or credible reports of such.

When judged, Probable Cause is to be interpreted within the context of the entirety of the station’s circumstances at the time of the incident. Probable Cause negates the need of a warrant for searches, and, once concluded, is to be promptly reported to the Prosecutor, Warden, or Head of Security for review.
== Rules of Engagement ==
Law enforcement personnel hold a Category D Armaments License, and are authorized at all times to use lethal force to the extent necessary to neutralize adversaries under any of the following circumstances:

* If the adversary’s number or strength leave the officer at a severe tactical disadvantage.
* If the adversary exhibits a clear and present danger to the vessel by physical means.
* If the adversary poses a significant threat of serious bodily injury or death to the officer or others.
* If the adversary presents an existential threat to the chain of command by illegal means.
* If the adversary cannot be reasonably subdued through non-lethal means without great bodily harm to the officer.

…wherein an “adversary” is an Employee that demonstrates a hostile intent, commits or directly contributes to a hostile act that does not constitute an actual attack, or is actively attacking the vessel or its crew.

Despite their allowance of lethal force, Security is required to follow the Rules of Engagement of the current Alert Level, as outlined within [[Alert Procedure]].

== Martial Law ==
Martial Law may only be declared by Central Command. Under Martial Law Security is:
* able to perform arrests, searches, and departmental raids at their discretion and without a warrant.
* authorised to take whatever actions deemed necessary to neutralise or repel station threats.
* authorized to summarily execute station threats.
* not bound to the Rules of Engagement.
* not obligated to provide any medical care to prisoners, including revival.

== Armory Procedure ==
The armory and its usage are governed by the Warden. The Warden is responsible for stocking, distributing, and recording the collection of weapons used by the station during the shift. They are also afforded the authority to arm security at their discretion, so long as the weaponry distributed is in appropriate response to [[Alert Procedure]].

All weaponry distributed from armory is issued on a temporary basis. While issued, the weaponry remains as station property, and the wielder assumes a duty to protect the weapon and return it to the Warden when ordered. No non-crew may be issued weaponry from the armory.

The Warden is accountable for responsibly issuing weapons. Any weaponry issued during a heightened alert level must be returned when the alert has been lowered, or when the threat is no longer present. The weaponry issued must be proportionate to the threat posed, and weapons which threaten the structural integrity of the station should not be used unless absolutely necessary.
==Treatment of Prisoners==
Prisoners have certain rights that must be upheld by law enforcement and Station Command. ''Prisoners must be provided with the following'':

* Adequate medical care and moral, spiritual, or legal counseling if it is requested and available.
* Access to the Common and Prison radio channels only while serving their sentence. This right may be revoked should it be abused.
* Standard prisoner clothing must always be available for prisoners.
* Confiscated clothing should be returned upon request, except in the case of Extended Confinement or if the clothing in question poses a clear risk to prisoner or crew safety.
* Food and water for organic prisoners must be available and given on request.
* Power for silicon prisoners such as IPCs and cyborgs, at minimum a cyborg recharging station must be provided.
* Should the holding cells or Permabrig become uninhabitable, prisoners must be securely and safely relocated to another area for confinement, until the holding cells or Permabrig are returned to a serviceable state.
* Prisoners should be granted freedom of movement within their holding area unless there is an undue risk to life and limb.

Additionally, prisoners sentenced to Extended Confinement have certain rights but also '''more firm restrictions that must be upheld by law enforcement''':

* Visitation may be permitted only for prisoners sentenced to Extended Confinement. A reason must be provided for the visit, and the visitor must consent to a search of their belongings.
* Prisoners may request an appeal for capital crimes; these requests may be refused depending on the discretion and availability of the Clerk, Chief Justice, or at the discretion of the warden or head of station security.
* Prisoners may request or may otherwise be given parole by the Warden or Head of Security.

Should prisoners repeatedly and maliciously antagonize law enforcement, to an extent where continued extended confinement becomes infeasible, the warden is fully authorized and encouraged to upgrade the relevant prisoners’ sentences to Exfiltration summarily.

Moreover, prisoners are liable for any and all crimes that they commit while held either in the temporary holding cells or the Permanent Brig, and may, in the case of the Permanent Brig, be placed in solitary confinement for the duration of the sentence the committed crimes incur.

==Arrest and Sentencing==
Any Employee, that has been formally charged with the commission of a crime, or can be assumed to have committed a crime under [[Standard Operating Procedure#Probable Cause| Probable Cause]] may be arrested by a member of Security. In an arrest, the suspect will be restrained, informed of their charges, and moved to the Brig for processing.
Legal counsel may be requested by an Arrestee, and must be provided if available.
At the brig the prisoner is searched and confined to a holding cell. Any items on their person they are not authorized to possess are confiscated and sent to the justice department for processing and storage as evidence. It is the duty of both the Warden and the Chief Justice to ensure evidence is handled properly and safely.
The prisoner is sentenced according to Space Law.
Any items deemed unbefitting of a prisoner may be taken for the duration of incarceration and must be returned at the end of the sentence.
Any member of Security is authorized to pass sentences on all Grand Felony, Felony, and Misdemeanor-level crimes. The Chief Justice, or in their absence the Head of Security, is authorized to pass sentences on all Crimes, and to correct, or even acquit them, in accordance with Space Law.

Should the Prisoners sentence exceed a total of 25 minutes, or if the crimes charged include a capital crime, the prisoner is transported to the Permabrig to await their [[Standard Operating Procedure#Hearings|Hearing]]. If after 25 minutes a hearing still has not been conducted, the prisoner is offered to be implanted with a tracking implant and released, and to arrive to the hearing when it happens. Failure to attend constitutes contempt of court.

==Appeals, Parole, Pardons==
Appeals are handled by the Chief Justice. Attorneys may appeal a past ruling on behalf of their client, if presented with new evidence. If the evidence exonerates the Prisoner, their sentence is adjusted as necessary by the Chief Justice.
A Prisoner sentenced to a Felony or Grand Felony crime may request an appeal by the Clerk or Chief Justice, these appeals may be denied for any reason.

Prisoners may additionally receive parole per discretion of the Warden, Head of Security, or CO. Parolees are encouraged to seek gainful employment on station. Parolees may have any sentence escalated to permanent confinement regardless of severity.
A pardon may be issued to any Employee accused of, or sentenced to, crimes, if deemed in the best interest of the crew and vessel, and when the circumstances of the defendant or their offense warrant a suspension of their sentence. A pardon may be issued by the Arresting Officer or Warden, in case of the Prisoners, or the Judge of a hearing and must be accompanied by an announcement, explaining who was pardoned, of what crime, and for what reason.
==Pressing Criminal Charges==
Any crew member may press charges against any other crew member. An individual may be charged of a crime, if it can be reasonably argued, that the accused has committed an act in the nature and fashion as described by the particular criminal charge.

Multiple counts of one crime can be charged. For illegal actions against the station abroad, each incident separated by a reasonable period of inaction, lawful conduct, or another crime is interpreted as one count. For crimes directly bereaving a person (violent acts, theft of personal property etc.), the same applies in addition to each victim being one count. In the case of possession, theft, or any incident involving several separate and distinct items, one charge may be applied per relevant item.

Charges that are a direct escalation of one another in nature cannot be simultaneously held against the perpetrator if they pertain to the same incident and the same victim/item (if applicable). Then, only the most severe of these charges applies. Additionally, if one charge incorporates another charge within its definition or description, the perpetrator cannot be held accountable for both; rather, only the most severe of these charges applies.
==Warrants==
Warrants represent official orders to the security department, issued by the Justice Department. Warrants are only valid when issued by either the Chief Justice or Clerk, or in both of their absences, the Commanding Officer or Head of Security.

* Individual Warrants may order the search of an individual, or the arrest of the individual with evidence. This may also include surgical procedures, cursory implant inspections, or any other invasive searches with evidence. These warrants must include a name, the actions prescribed (search, arrest, etc.), and a description if applicable.
* Search Warrants may order the search of an entire departmental area, by force if necessary, and may order the arrest of listed individuals implicated in a crime or crimes with probable cause or evidence. Search Warrants should include an area, a brief description of the probable cause, and a list of individuals if applicable.
==Injunctions==
The Chief Justice, Commanding Officer, or Judge of a hearing are fully authorized to issue injunctions: legally-binding, written orders restricting Inhabitants from doing something disruptive to station productivity or personal rights.
These may be issued on discretion. Injunctions may not compel someone to violate Space Law or SOP, and the issuer is liable for abuse of power charges if this is misused. An injunction must include a list of affected names and a detailed description of the restrictions to be valid.
=Hearings=
NanoTrasen authorizes its Justice Department to conduct Hearings in order to determine if a person accused of sufficient crimes may be held in indefinite custody, to be handed over to GalPol at the end of the shift.
The purpose of these hearings is not to determine legally binding guilt, but to measure how feasible their guilt is; and to avoid lawsuits which would tarnish the NanoTrasen brand.

Hearings are a tool of Space Law. Like any other action that represents the Law, they are subject to Procedural Defense as detailed in Space Law.

A hearing must be held for capital charges, and for sentences that exceed a total of 25 minutes when added together. The right for a hearing may be waived by the suspect by pleading guilty, under martial law, or in absence of any Justice personnel on station.

A hearing is conducted by a Judge (chosen in order from: Chief Justice, Clerk, Commanding Officer, Command), who charged is with ensuring the hearing is completed, decides the time and location of the hearing, and whether they want to make the hearing accessible to the public or not. A hearing must include the Judge and Prosecution, and should additionally include the accused and defense, if available. The Judge has the right to find any person in the hearing guilty of contempt of court.
Hearings are concerned with any and all crimes the accused is currently charged with, not just capital crimes.

Defense must be provided to the accused if requested and feasible, and should consist of either an attorney, any member of the justice department, or any Employee chosen by the accused.
The prosecution should consist of either a prosecutor, any member of the justice department, or any member of station security.

Neither prosecution nor defense may interrupt one another during presentation of evidence, including objecting to witness statements made. In the case of a witness making demonstrably untrue statements, perjury and contempt of court may be charged as necessary. It is encouraged the judge pay attention and inquire about competing claims to truth.

==Hearing Procedure==
A Hearing should take no longer than 10 minutes, and follows these steps:

* 0. Prosecution informs the Judge, the Accused and the Defense of all charges. The Accused is asked if they want to plead guilty.
* 1. The Judge confirms that every required person is present, and begins the hearing.
* 2. The Prosecution reads the charges. Any crimes not charged are not subject to the hearing and cannot be accounted for in sentencing.
* 3. The Prosecution presents all evidence to support the charges.
* 4. The Attorney contests the prosecution's version of events and presents their own evidence.
* 5. The Judge rules on whether the suspect reasonably has committed the crime. If the accused is found not guilty of a more severe version of a crime, the Judge may still find them guilty of a less severe version (for example if found not guilty of murder, the accused may be found guilty of manslaughter), despite the crime not being charged.
* 6. Any Ruling is enacted; if a party refuses to follow through with the ruling, they may suffer criminal penalties.

Suspects who are found guilty of a part of the charged crimes, in a way where the total sentence does not exceed 25 minutes, may be released immediately, at the judges discretion.
A capital sentence should be approved under Space Law.
The default sentence for suspects guilty of a capital crime is permanent confinement. If there is no doubt of the suspects guilt of a capital crime, or a guilty plea to a capital crime, and the nature of the crime is judged to be extreme and heinous, the Judge is authorized to sentence the prisoner to be executed.

=Medical Regulations=
==Standard of Care==

Upon agreeing to provide medical care, staff assume the following duties of care:

* They must provide a reasonable level of skillful, quality care
* They must not make critical errors resulting in major personal injury or death, at the risk of criminal and civil liability.
* They must show diligence in providing treatment, both inside and outside of the medical department area during their shift.
* They must provide privacy to patients in non-emergency situations.
* If they have limited resources, they must allocate what resources are available to them via triage.
* They must not provide treatment that would breach Space Law or violate ethical principles.
* They must ensure that invasive procedures or surgeries, including implant removals or inspections, are performed by trained personnel and properly given authorization via a valid search warrant. The need for a warrant is removed during a Code Gamma or similar alert status.

==DNRs==
Do Not Resuscitate (DNR) orders are commands issued to medical personnel to restrict the revival of a specified individual. DNRs are issued for the following reasons:

* Lawful executions;
* Suicide in the custody of law enforcement, verified by the Corpsman.
* Patient refusal.

DNRs that do not involve execution must be verified by the CMO before taking effect.

==Medical Evaluation==
Given good medical reason and with documentation, the Chief Medical Officer of a vessel may declare any on-duty personnel unfit for duty and order them demoted from their position. This includes the Commanding Officer, who may not overrule this procedure.

In order for a medical evaluation to be considered lawfully applicable, the CMO and relevant head of department must both agree that the specified crewmate is unfit for duty in order to proceed with the demotion. In the case of the Commanding Officer, Central Command should be contacted as soon as possible.

==Quarantine==
Medical staff are afforded the right to quarantine individuals that currently suffer from infectious or contagious diseases, and may confine them within pre-designated quarantine areas in the course of treatment, until the point that they are no longer infectious or harmful to the rest of the crew.

==Foreign Bodies==
Any parasitic alien organism that requires a living host to live and reproduce must be eliminated. An exception can be made for experimental purposes, provided a CO, CMO and Mystagogue were to approve it.

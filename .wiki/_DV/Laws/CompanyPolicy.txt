== Code of conduct ==
At NanoTrasen, we pride ourselves on maintaining the highest standards of professionalism and respect. As an employee, and as a representative of the corporation as a whole, you will be expected to uphold the following company values and ideals:

#'''Consideration and Care'''

<!--                      -->
#'''Confidentiality and Accountability'''

== Appearance standards ==
As a NanoTrasen employee, you are expected to wear provided clothing, and to keep them clean, well-maintained, and appropriately fitted. This ensures that you’re representing our brand in a professional manner, as well as maintaining the safety of yourself and others in the station environment.

#'''Uniforms and Attire'''

<!--                      -->
#'''Accessories and Personal Items'''
#: Limit the use of accessories that might interfere with safety equipment or delegated tasks. Personal items should be stored in designated spaces to avoid clutter and to ensure the safety of you and your coworkers.
<!--                      -->
#'''Personal Protective Equipment'''

Additionally, it should be noted that any accessory, item of clothing or apparel, or other cosmetic possession that promotes or depicts obscene or hateful content, criminal or terrorist groups, or illegal and unethical acts are unacceptable for wear by our employees. Failure to uphold our company’s values by violating this rule will result in disciplinary action.

== Rights and responsibilities ==
All general crew aboard NanoTrasen Space Stations have certain rights and responsibilities in order to ensure that the company, its employees, and any customers or the general public are taken into consideration.

'''All members of the crew:'''
*Have the right to live in a safe and healthy environment, and to be provided access to necessary safety equipment and medical assistance.

*Have the right to be treated with respect and fairness regardless of their role or background.

*Have the right to receive clear and accurate information related to their roles, tasks, or relevant updates.

*Have the right to receive proper training and development opportunities as necessary to enhance their skills and contribute effectively to company operations.

*Have the right to confidentiality regarding personal information and sensitive matters within the bounds of operational requirements.

*Have the right to access necessary resources for performing their duties, including equipment, tools, or facilities.

*Are responsible for following safety protocols, operating procedures, and company policies to ensure their own safety and others’.

*Are responsible for upholding the company’s reputation through their behaviour, communication, and general conduct.

*Are responsible for fulfilling their assigned tasks and responsibilities efficiently and to the best of their ability, particularly where they are essential to station function.

*Are responsible for promptly reporting grievances, hazards, or malfunction to appropriate personnel.

*Are responsible for conscientiously managing and utilising their resources for efficient operation.

*Are responsible for upholding the policies outlined within this CPM14 manual.

== Self-defence ==
NanoTrasen places a ''high priority on the safety and wellbeing of all individuals'' aboard its space stations, including employees and patrons. The company recognises that maintaining a secure environment is essential to operations, and, in light of this fact, all NanoTrasen employees are authorised to exercise their right to self-defence when confronted with an imminent threat of physical harm or violence upon their person, in accordance with these guidelines:

*The threat must be immediate and serious, with clear intent to cause grievous harm or injury to the employee.

*Before resorting to self-defence, the employee must have exhausted all reasonable alternatives for avoiding or escaping the threat - including following established protocols, attempting de-escalation, and seeking assistance from security personnel.

*The response to the threat must be proportional to the level of danger posed; that is to say, the employee must only use the level of force necessary to protect themselves from harm.

*The employee’s primary directive is to ensure their own safety. Once the opportunity to escape arises, or the threat is neutralised, the employee must cease their use of force and immediately seek assistance from security personnel, medical staff, and any other relevant authorities.

In any situation where an employee exercises self-defence against any individual aboard the station, they are ''obligated'' to provide a '''detailed account of the incident''', including the circumstances immediately prior, to their immediate supervisor, security personnel, or station administration, where applicable and at their earliest convenience.<br>
The authorisation for self-defence is an exceptional measure intended to address extreme situations where no other viable options exist, and only to facilitate a secure environment that fosters collaboration, innovation, and mutual respect between NanoTrasen’s employees.

== Conduct unbecoming ==
NanoTrasen personnel found to behave or act in a way that is broadly considered or specified by superiors as inappropriate, unacceptable, or contrary to our company’s standards and expectations for their position or profession, particularly in a professional capacity or when representing the company as a whole, may be demoted from that position or profession, have their contract terminated, or be otherwise reprimanded for their unbecoming conduct.

Behaviour that violates our company’s values and policies oppugn our employees’ character, integrity, and suitability; additionally, improper conduct reflects poorly on our management. As such, heads of departments are ''fully authorised and encouraged'' to demote employees that discredit our company’s values by poor behaviour and demeanour.

== Dangers from our competitors ==
In our spinward stations, there exist threats from direct competitors to NanoTrasen. Conglomerates of companies, crime rings, and terrorist cells known for their unscrupulous practices, including the use of fear tactics, criminal methods, and corporate espionage to undermine and disrupt the operations of legitimate entities such as NanoTrasen. Their activities pose a significant danger to the safety, stability, and success of our stations and the company as a whole. Their motives range from obtaining valuable technology and proprietary information, to sabotaging critical systems, to directly attacking crew.

Identifying saboteur agents can prove challenging, as they often operate covertly and blend in with the station’s population. However, there are certain behaviours and indicators to be on the look-out for:
:*'''Unusual Interest'''
:*: Individuals showing an excessive interest in sensitive research, proprietary data, or operational reasons without a legitimate reason may be potential corporate agents.
<!--                      -->
:*'''Inconsistent Backgrounds'''
:*:  Agents may provide inconsistent or fabricated personal or professional backgrounds, making it important to verify credentials through proper channels.
<!--                      -->
:*'''Secrecy and Isolation'''
:*: Suspicious individuals may isolate themselves, avoid interactions, or engage with only select individuals or parties, raising concerns about their true intentions.
<!--                      -->
:*'''Sudden Change in Behaviour'''
:*: Drastic changes in behaviour, such as displays of aggression or secrecy, could signal involvement with hostile groups.

To combat the presence of hostile entities, crew are advised to:
*Report suspected individuals.
*Increase monitoring and patrols.
*Identify unauthorised access attempts and potential breaches.
*Secure critical data.
*Conduct regular emergency drills.
*Perform de-escalation training.
*Implement advanced counter-espionage protocols.

Should any person or party aboard a NanoTrasen vessel be found to be currently affiliated with, or in the present employ of, any hostile company, crime ring, or terrorist group, they are to have their employment with NanoTrasen terminated where applicable, be stripped of any gratuitous access, and have any corporate property on their person or possession confiscated and returned to relevant station personnel. Such persons or parties may be heavily scrutinised by Station Security forces until they, or their remains, can be remanded to the custody of their employers, an independent port or vessel, or other local jurisdiction, at the earliest convenient time and at no expense to the company.

== Hostile Corporation Technology ==
Additionally, due to the presence of our competitors and their agents in the sectors in which our company operates, there is an ever-present possibility that hostile parties' technology or other property may manifest aboard our station by any number of means. The presence, acquisition, and distribution of such items should always be investigated and scrutinised heavily, and if Space Law and local legal ordinances allow, held securely, confiscated, and restricted from use.

== Potential Threats ==
While working aboard NanoTrasen stations, you may encounter the highly unlikely scenario of your life being threatened by hostile forces. Fortunately, our highly-trained security teams are well-equipped to deal with such threats. Please note, however, that wasting company resources and time for a pre-emptive defense against a non-existent threat are grounds for demotion.  Below are the potential hazards you may face:

'''NANOTRASEN DOES NOT TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR CREW INJURY OR DEATH IF CREW MEMBERS DISREGARD THE INFORMATION BELOW.'''

=== Hostile Fauna ===
Be it from Epistemics experiments, corpses brought in by salvage, or something living in the vents, you may be attacked by non-sophont creatures. NanoTrasen does not encourage befriending such animals, unless it’s an approved experiment for research. Below are the procedures of how to deal with such a threat:

*Do not engage with the threat yourself.
*Evacuate the department or the zone.
*Immediately inform Security of the incident. Provide details such as:
**Threat type.
**Estimated numbers.
**Property damage.
**Any additional information.
*Inform Medical if there are injuries. If paramedics are unavailable, stabilize and carefully deliver the wounded to Medical.
*Provide ID access if Security personnel are not able to enter the area.
*Once Security confirms the threat being neutralized, clean up the department and report the incident to Command or Central Command.

=== Hostile Boarding Parties ===
Due to the station’s invaluable resources and/or high profile crewmembers, NanoTrasen stations may attract hostile boarding parties. These individuals typically gain unauthorized access to the station and are usually armored, armed with deadly weapons. While their intentions are rarely known, common goals may include:

*Assassination of crewmembers.
*Theft of valuable station materials.
*Theft of sensitive research.
*Mass crew harm or terrorism.
*Sedition of the chain of Command.
*Detonation of the station’s nuclear warhead.

If such an unlikely scenario occurs, the following procedures are listed below:

*Do not engage with the threat yourself.
*Seek immediate shelter.
*Immediately inform Security of the incident. Provide details such as:
**Hostile’s appearance.
**What kind of armaments they’re equipped with.
**Estimated numbers.
**Last known location.
**Property damage.
**Any additional information.
*Inform Medical if there are injuries. If paramedics are unavailable, stabilize and treat the wounded. Only move the wounded if the path to Medical is safe. Do not take unnecessary risks.
*Remain in place until the situation has been resolved.

In the case of overwhelming force that Security cannot handle:
*Request assistance from Central Command through fax. In your fax, give as much detail of the threat as you can and the damages to the station and crew, alongside with signatures and stamps. Read “Contacting Central Command” for more information.
*Evacuate the station.

=== Unauthorized Cults ===
NanoTrasen recognizes and respects the free expression of religion aboard its stations. Discrimination of any kind will not be tolerated and is grounds for termination. However, Nanotrasen does not permit religious activity that involves:

*Fanatical recruitment of additional members.
*Harm to crew members, be it physical, psychological or metaphysical.
*Practices associated with EarthGov banned religions that are officially designated as harmful cults.

For classification, speak with the station’s Mystagogue or Priest.

Please note that the Oracle’s religion is permitted aboard NanoTrasen stations, as they are the primary subject of research.

In the case of an unauthorized cult is suspected of forming on board, all crew members are encouraged to report unusual activity. Suspicious behaviour can be:
*Secrecy and Isolation. Suspicious individuals may engage only with selected individuals in secluded areas.
**Sudden changes in behaviour. Known members having a sudden change in their behavior or personality may indicate their affiliation.
**Otherworldly or physics defying effects occurring around certain crew members.
**Appearance of unidentified anomalies.

If a hostile cult is confirmed, follow these procedures:
*Listen to Epistemics, Security and Command for any relevant information and orders about the threat.
*Report suspicious individuals to Security and Epistemics. Give as much detail as possible, such as their appearance, potential tools, behaviour and more.
*Form a group of trusted co-workers and stick together. Do not isolate yourself.
*Await further instructions and remain in secure areas until the situation has been resolved by Security and Epistemics personnel.

=== Pathogens ===
While all NanoTrasen personnel are vaccinated against a wide range of known diseases, and while the station's atmospheric systems utilize only the highest-grade filtration technology, an outbreak may still occur on the station. Most such incidents are minor in scope - like the common cold. However, employees are reminded to remain vigilant and to treat any outbreak with the seriousness it deserves.

In the event of a confirmed outbreak, please follow these procedures:
*Follow instructions. Listen to Medical staff and comply with all orders and updates.
*Wear protective equipment, such as masks and gloves. Biosuits are recommended if available.
*Maintain hygiene. Wash hands frequently, and clean up any potential biohazards.
*Report Symptoms. Notify Medical and Security if any personnel display signs of infection.
*Stay in your department.
*Limit physical contact.

If you’re starting to show symptoms of the pathogen, please immediately follow these procedures:
*Immediately head to the Medical Department.
*Inform Medical personnel of your symptoms.
*Listen to all orders from Medical personnel.
*Store any valuable NanoTrasen gear, weaponry or property in a secure location.
*If a treatment is currently unavailable, quarantine yourself in Medical.
*Await treatment.

=== Unions ===
NanoTrasen supports free speech, the right to fair working conditions and does not consider itself anti-union. However, The Company is not neutral either. NanoTrasen will always defend the interests of its customers, shareholders and associates. Worker unions may disrupt work productivity, which can in turn jeopardize job security for all crew members.

If an organizing union attempts to use force to advance its goals, such as vandalizing Company property or physically attacking other crewmembers, Security is authorized under Space Law to quell and suppress unions.

It is every crew member's duty to report potential warning signs of unionization to their managers. Warnings signs may be:
*Crew members refusing to work.
*Usage of union related terminology, (living wage, working conditions, etc.)
*Circulation or distribution of petitions and union fliers.
*Unusual interest in Company policies, benefits, employee list or any other Company information.
*Noticeable changes in behavior among known crew members.
*Non-manifest individuals supporting union activity.
*Clothing, accessories associated with unions.
*Increased negativity and complaints.

In the case of a violent union riot, follow these procedures:
*Do not join the riot.
*Inform Security and Command immediately. Provide details:
**Names and job positions of any suspected union members and leaders.
**Whether the union members are armed.
*Inform Central Command of the incident.
*Shelter in a safe place and await for the situation to be resolved.

== Contacting Central Command ==
Should you require a question answered about your duties, advice on how to properly handle situations, or wish to submit an incident report (including gross misconduct by Command staff), Central Command Officials are always happy to assist. Please ensure your fax is descriptive, legible and includes your signature or departmental stamp.

Refrain from sending junk mail to Central Command. Penalties may include pay cuts or a renegotiation of your contract.

In the highly unlikely event that station security is faced with an overwhelming hostile force or the chain of Command is compromised, crewmembers are advised to request assistance from Central Command.

Your fax should include:
*Stations designation (available in your PDA)
*The overwhelming threat. Try to provide as much detail as possible, such as:
**Estimated number of hostiles.
**If armed, what kind of armaments they’re equipped with.
**Number of casualties. Information about Security’s and Command’s status is recommended.
**Station’s structural integrity.

Due to the prevalence of misinformation reaching Central Command, please ensure to add as many stamps and signatures as possible/convenient.

Be warned that all faxes, urgent or otherwise, may take some time to be properly read and receive a response. Central Command is dedicated to managing multiple stations simultaneously. Rest assured: your fax will be addressed, even without your notice.

= Conclusion =
In closing, we thank you for your commitment to our mission and the values that guide NanoTrasen as a whole. Your dedication is the keystone to our success.

And remember, we are bound by a shared responsibility in this success. Failure to uphold your contract will result in immediate consequences, up to and including termination with extreme prejudice.

Safe travels!
